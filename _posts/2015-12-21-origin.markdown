What is a Jeffaccino?
---

Some of you may be wondering "What is a Jeffaccino, and why would you buy that
domain name?" Well, you have every right to question that and I'm sure you've
already come up with some hilarious fan fiction writings that you might even
think about turning into a novella. Firstly, if that's the case I'd love to
read said novella, please send it to me at <jeffaccino@gmail.com>. Yeah, I got
the email address too. Secondly, there is a reason I've procured said domain
name and this post will hopefully reveal and explain its origin.

Before deciding to travel I started working at a company called
[Siaras](http://siaras.com){:target="_blank"}. This is a start up company with
an office in Burnaby. If you enjoy or have any experience with cloud computing,
networking, or the Python programming language at all I would recommend
applying to this company. This company is full of intelligent and qualified
people who also happen to be fun to work with goofballs. Beginning in September
of 2014, I started as a junior software developer with the company. Now, as a
developer you might assume that I drink a lot of coffee. This assumption is,
however, completely incorrect. When I drink caffeinated beverages, I tend to go
for tea, and ever now and then I'll go through a phase of drinking ridiculous
amounts of the stuff, but, I save coffee for special occasions.

I'll take this time to talk about how I "use" coffee as opposed to just "drink"
coffee. For the most part, I do not drink large amounts of caffeinated beverages
during the day so I like to think that my caffeine tolerance is quite low. When
I have a cup of black tea, I'll feel it in my body, my alertness will rise, my
hands might have almost the feeling of a quiver in them, my productivity will
change depending on whether or not I was feeling tired beforehand. These are
mostly good effects of caffeine for me. For some reason, even if the coffee
doesn't contain as much caffeine as the tea, when I drink coffee I get super
powers. My productivity goes up regardless, my hands tremor, my eyes widen, I
get. Shit. Done. But I recognize that if I do this all the time my tolerance
will most likely increase and in order to maintain the same level of effect I
would need to drink more and more coffee, a habit in which I do not wish to
indulge.  For this reason I am not known to drink coffee.

With that in mind, my coworkers at Siaras noticed this fairly quickly and upon
the arrival of our new coffee behemoth a new drink was born. This machine is
a giant of the coffee making world standing taller that 6'0" that makes noises
that interrupt your train of thought if you're standing too close. It is a
touch screen-controlled, automated, force to be reckoned with. Behold!

During our orientation of the system by the man who had performed the machine's
installation, we were invited to try it out. The room was quite and everybody's
eyes were darting around the room. I decided to break the ice and, instead of
using the machine for its intended purpose, decided to have myself a hot
chocolate instead of a coffee. Some people laughed, others didn't, but I felt
good about my choice.

Perhaps a few weeks later some of the employees, being software developers,
decided to hack the coffee machine. They got their way into the maintenance
screen and even ended up guessing the administration password. With this, we
could hook the machine up to our wifi, alter displayed menu text, change
cleaning schedules, the works! It was at this time one of the employees decided
that the non-coffee drink category could use a new name. As I was the first
person to have a non-coffee drink from the machine, Jeffacino was born. The
machine's main screen now sports two categories to choose from at the start of
your hot beverage journey: Coffee or Jeffacino.

I've since created a drink that is also known as Jeffaccino that I have nearly
every day at 3:00 PM that a small group of us attend that we call Coffee Time.
This drink is one peppermint patty broken up into pieces followed by hot
hot chocolate, a stir to dissolve the patty, and a splash of milk. Best enjoyed
with friends.

And there you have it, the reason I have such an awesome name for my blog. Let
me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to answer them.
