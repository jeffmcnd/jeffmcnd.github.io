First Pass, The Regular Route - Mar 15
---
I'm only going to write about the interesting parts, however, I'm going to
write as though the sentences were coherent. So I'm at the lookout point of
San Miguel de Allende thinking "This isn't that great." I made a few plans
with someone I met in Acapulco who is now studying in Mexico City. I walked
the city. I read a bunch of *Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal.* I was
pleasantly surprise with how easily it read for me. Sure, I'm not getting
**every word** but I'm reading it with relative ease. I stayed reading until
the end of the first chapter. The taco place that I went to last night wasn't
open. I walked some more, noticing more and more that this seems to be a
slow paced town where a lot of old, white vacationers come to visit. There
doesn't seem to be a lot for me here. I started into the *Mercado de
Artesanias* and found a place to each lunch. I got a *torta* which in Mexico,
sometimes, doesn't mean cake and actually means sandwich. I also had a
strawberry *licuado.*

I got back to the hostel and decided I would dedicate the rest of the day to
Spanish. I spent most of my time watching Youtube videos, listening to random
Spanish audio, and trying to learn the lyrics to A Dios le Pido by Juanes.
Soon enough a couple of German girls came into the room who speak Spanish
quite well. Granted, they also speak English, however, they prefer speaking in
Spanish because they think they're English is worse. Perfect for me. We
chatted for a bit about they usual topics and they headed out. I would have
gone with them but they said they were going through the market again and that
doesn't interest me much, especially because they told me they needed to by
presents for their impending return home to Germany. Though I suppose I
missed out on more Spanish practice. Shit.

Now I'm on the terrace writing this post thinking about whether or not I
should read more HP, yeah I'm abbreviating it now, or go out for dinner, or
wait for the others to come back and then have dinner, or go out for dinner
with the singing couple I saw in Guanajuato that are staying in the hostel.
My mind is swimming. I'll probably end up watching completely useless videos
on the internet. It's funny how easily hold habits come back to life.

Some photos for your viewing pleasure.

After a bit more waiting I was at the hostel where my other roommate, Michael,
from South Africa was sitting. The German girls were also in the common area.
I talked for Michael for a bit even though my main goal was more Spanish
practice with the girls. Eventually, I decided that I would cancel my last
night and head to Mexico City with the Germans.

Two Germans and a Canadian Speaking Spanish - Mar 16
---
After breakfast and a bit of waiting, the Germans and I were setting out to
the market to shop for some presents. I didn't buy anything because I'm not
at the end of my trip like they are. This was a great day for Spanish
conversation practice and that's exactly what I did. I showed them Anki and
used a it few times when I heard some words I wasn't familiar with, took a
picture to help remind me and Miriam told me that I was here dream student
Both of the Germans are in a Spanish program in university in Germany with
a minor in physical education. Confidence boost.

Once we were done with the market we walked up to the lookout of San Miguel
de Allende, through the Bonito Juarez Park. Both places I've already visited
but that didn't matter because I had nothing to do with my day anyway and
the amount of improvement you get from speaking Spanish instead of reading
or listening is immense. We grabbed some lunch at the torta place I went to
yesterday and arrived at the hostel, called a cab, and got tickets for the
earlier, less expensive, longer bus to Mexico City.

All I did on the bus was relax and watch movies and chat with the Germans a
little bit. When we arrived at the bus station they bought their tickets and
we said goodbye. I took a cab to my hostel which has less than impressive beds
but both breakfast and lunch are included. Since Nick was in town, we went
out for some tacos and beer. Good times were had. I'm basically just following
his trail through Mexico at this point, I'm just taking a few more days in
the towns he visits. We'll be seeing each other in Merida for sure but I'm
not sure where else in between.

Acapulco Reunion - Mar 17
---
I spent most of the morning doing close to nothing today as I had made plans
to meet up with a girl I met in Acapulco named Carla. So I passed my time
confirming my CS accommodations in Mexico City, four nights with a girl named
Abi. Check. I did some reading. Check. I watched some Spanish Youtube videos.
Check. I read up a bit on Mexico City even though I don't have anything in
particular that I want to do here. I more so want the people I know to take
me places they like. I did most of my touristy stuff during the last visit.
The two things I want to do are pyramids which Carla and I plan on doing and
the Monarch butterfly reserve which might actually be closed now, who knows.

I spent my time like this until about 3pm when I went stir crazy and had to
leave. I grabbed some 10 peso tacos de pastor and went to Alameda Central to
chill. I spent almost an hour and a half just watching people pass by. People
watching is one of my favourite pass times while travelling so this was
enjoyable for me. I had stopped to sit at a spot near a fountain and for some
reason a lot of teenagers would either play in it or attempt to push
each other in because, you know, it's fun being drenched in water on a typical
Mexico City, not that warm, late in the day, day. There were also a few
free style rappers that were walking around rapping for money which was pretty
cool. At one point they approached the kids next to me on the bench and I'm
pretty sure they made a few cracks about me, the gringo, and how I probably
don't speak Spanish. I sure showed them by not saying anything.

After Carla's class in the Zocalo ended, I met up with her, her professor, and
a good portion of her classmates in a bar called *La Burra Blanca.* They
serve *pulque* there which is an "alcoholic drink made by fermenting sap from
the maguey" [1]. They had several flavours, some of which were good and others
which were not good. One tip, don't smell it. It always smells bad but once
you get it down they can be pretty OK. At one point a man sitting behind us
was drinking out of one of the leaves of a maguey plant. He showed us how to
do it so Carla gave it a shot. No issues. I had some. No issues. Then, as
I was holding it, he filled it to the brim. I tried to hand it to one of
Carla's friends and managed to spill both on myself and the girl. I felt bad
because that stuff stinks. Woops.

We hung out for a couple hours drinking *pulque* and beer, just talking about
languages again. I seriously cannot get enough of it especially when I'm
talking about it in a language I'm learning. Heaven. People left bit by bit
and eventually so did we. The plan was to go to Bar27 that night so we hung
out at Carla's place for a bit and headed out. I had a lot of fun at this bar.
Though I've been told it is usually more packed. But still, not bad for a
Thursday. Good times were had. Thanks Carla!

Squeezing Through the Subway - Mar 18
---
I got out of bed as late as possible in order to get as much sleep as I could
considering the fact that I got back to the hostel at 3am. I had breakfast
and packed up everything because I was changing from a hostel to my CS host.
I stored my bags in the hostel and head for the *metrobus.* Google mislead me
a little bit with its directions. There is a line that goes straight to the
UNAM campus but it told me to take two different lines and a bus. I don't know
what that was about but I eventually got on the straight to UNAM line. Five
pesos, super cheat, super easy.

![UNAM](/img/unam-biblioteca.jpg)

The UNAM campus is quite nice, quite large, and there were a lot of people out
and about just doing activities. I'm not sure how else to put that. There
was ping pong, dance classes, copoeira class, volleyball, basketball, soccer,
frisbee, group discussions, tons of couples, etc. It seems like a cool place
to learn, though I still got a bunch of looks that said "We don't get a lot
of white folk around these parts." After checking out the main library and
the stadium I met up with Carla. We grabbed some lunch and then tried to visit
a bar for some variation of *micheladas* because I told her that I didn't
like the one I had in Merida. Her friend picked us up in her car and we found
the restaurant. The drinks were not like I had before, they were incredibly
sweet and it was hard to tell there was any beer in them. A bit later Carla's
sister arrived as well and we chatted for a while.

Later on Carla's sister dropped me off at the subway. Once I got off at my
stop it was hard to get off the thing. There was a wall of people waiting and
in order to get off you have to fight your way through the people. Not quite
like a busy Vancouver Skytrain. I grabbed my things from the hostel and took
an Uber to Abi's apartment. Upon arrival I was greeted by Abi and her six
friends who were all drinking in preparation for the night we were about to
have. Cool.

We ended up hanging out and going out to a bunch of bars via Uber. It was a
great night but it did go on for quite a while, quite late. I don't remember
what time it was we got back but I think it was in the order of 5am. Wooo!

Little Sleep and Lots of Stairs - Mar 19
---
A few hours after going to sleep and I woke up. Woo! I quickly sent Carla my
location via WhatsApp so she could find me for our day at *Teotihuacan*, ate
my oats, and waited in the street for her to pick me up. And so began our day
together.

This is what I woke up to. He was fully asleep.

I got along with Carla well. We didn't stop talking during the entire trip
out to Teotihuacan. It was a bit easier to do this because today I had
promised to speak English with her. After all, I got almost two full days of
Spanish from her so it was only fair. We walked all around the site, scaling
the large pyramids with ease of course. We took some time to sit and relax
on the Pyramid of the Sun and continued chatting. It was an awesome time and
I can't thank her enough for taking me out there. Also it was the first time
there for both of us, so there you go.

After the road trip back we got some late lunch/early dinner and then a frappe
with tapioca balls, chocolate chip mint, tasty. We spent around two hours
sitting in the cafe talking about what we should do next before we realized
that we should go close to Abi's house and grab a tea. Another great idea.
We spent the next few hours sitting and lying in the big gazeobo-like thing
(I've forgotten what they're called) talking about stuff and trying tongue
twisters in English and Spanish, eventually switching to French and German but
those didn't go well. One interesting and sort of disappointing topic that
came up was that since we had been speaking English the entire day, when I
tried to speak Spanish I had more of a Canadian accent than normal. This
scared me a bit because I think having a good accent is one of the most
important parts of the language learning process for me. I hope it doesn't
stick around for too long. Another sad thing was that Carla leaves for Peru
tomorrow and won't be around while I'm still in Mexico City. Bummer. Thanks
for being super awesome, Carla! I hope we can meet up again sometime in the
future.

The rest of the night was spent finding Abi, bailing on the party because I
was too tired, getting keys to the apartment and falling asleep. Woo?
