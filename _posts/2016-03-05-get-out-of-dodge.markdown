Last Day With Shaun, Good Riddance - Mar 01
---
Shaun, Sascha, and I went to Esperanza, the restaurant where Cabiri works, for
some breakfast even though I had eaten my daily oatmeal breakfast. We had some
tasty treats along side Cabiri including this amazing cucumber, lime, and magic
mix that apparently included three ounces of booze. You couldn't tell it was
in there, be careful if you order one of those things. We then went to the
beach for a little relaxing. When we arrived we spent some time chatting with
this guy that Shaun knows named Manny, pretty cool dude. Spiritual as well. We
sat around talking about the less usual stuff because we had been through the
regular topics beginning with the questions "Where are you from?" "What do you
do?" "Can I bum a few pesos off you?" We talked future plans, where we were
going to get our next paycheck from, how we feel about the trip, languages (of
course, I've been pressing this topic a lot), and just general inquiries into
our lives. It was rather cool to hear about these two fine gentlemen. Even
though I've only known them for a few days, it seems that you're able to get a
lot more out of a person while traveling.

After the beach we spent the next few hours walking around town, picking up a
few things that Shaun needed for his return home, bumping into people we know,
and eating. All of a sudden, the dreaded hour arrived and we, being Mel, Jake,
and I, walked Shaun to his bus. Then he left us. Just like that. Almost as
though he didn't want to stay. Almost like he had somewhere to be. Bastard. At
any rate, I know I'll be seeing him again because he's a Vancouverite but I was
a bit sad to see him go. He's been a good friend and I pulled a few personality
quirks from him. He's outgoing, adventurous, not easily embarrassed, and not
afraid to ask for what he wants. Granted, the last one is more in regards to 
ordering food and bartering with the locals but I think it applies. Those are
all things that I may possess in some quantity but still would like to spend
time developing. Thanks for the great week and a bit, Shaun, I look forward to
seeing you this summer!

After Shaun left most of the hostel was in recovery mode still so I spent some
time relaxing. Rumor, Mel, Jake, and I went for a swim at the beach and it was
here, for the first time, that I realized that I should probably try surfing
for real. I caught a few decent waves body surfing over in the beginner surf
side of the bay and thought, yeah, it's time. I then decided to try it out
after our trip to San Pancho the next day. Should be fun.

The night was spent trying to get cheaper and cheaper beer because my daily
budget of 200 pesos was draining quickly. Then after chatting with some of the
people in the staff dorm room we decided a movie was in order. I suggested
Disney, because I'm not afraid to ask for what I want (see above). We landed on
Aladdin obviously because alphabetical order is important. That's about it,
Carla, Maria, Jake, Brian, and I spent Tequila Tuesday watching Aladdin. It was
good.

San Pancho and Wedding Crashing - Mar 2
---
A little bit of a late start for most today. I felt completely stellar because
all I did was watch Aladdin the night before so I woke up just after 7am and
hoped on my computer to get a head start on some blogging. Which is a marvel
of an idea by the way. There is definitely a correlation between quality of
post and the time between doing something and writing about it. Strange. Once
Jake and I wrangled a team (Jake, Elliot, Brian, Rumor, Anna from Brazil)
together for the San Pancho trip we headed out a bit after 11am. It was
surprising that the bus was 15 pesos considering that the distance is so damn
short. Granted that is a little bit over a dollar, but still. One becomes a bit
cheap when you live in Mexico I think.

From what I saw, San Pancho isn't all that much the see. The beach is pretty
nice but there isn't much shade that you don't have to pay for. The waves were
also a bit choppy and the rip current was strong. At one point we decided to
play a little bit of soccer. Mistake. I'm so out of shape, it's hilarious. Of
course, playing anything that isn't normally played in sand makes it that much
harder but still there is not a lot of athleticism left in me. We played
a bit of "I'm going to a picnic and I'm bringing _____." which is a fun little
game where you pick a rule or two for items that people can bring to a picnic.
You then get your friends to guess what they can bring and tell them if they
were correct or not by telling them if they can come to the picnic or not.
For example you could say that only items that start with the letter "K" can
be brought to the picnic, or things with a certain colour. It was actually
quite fun. Thanks for that one, Jake. We then headed back to Sayulita and began
puttering around, having the occasional drink until we got some delicious tacos
al pastor. Love those things.

We surfed at this point. It was pretty fun. I managed to catch and stand up
on three separate occasions. Whether or not they were waves or just white wash
is up for debate but it was tonnes of fun. I might start to enjoy this.

When we came back to the hostel a few people were a little more dressed up than
normal. Of course, they had heard about a wedding going on and were planning
on crashing it. Since I had just got myself a haircut I figured I'd throw on
my collared shirt and go along. What a great night. We started by walking
past the wedding on the beach, sitting down and then sending in Maria to
introduce herself to the wedding party. After a quick dance she came back with
Scott, a guy I met at the hostel, and we convince his friend Matt to let us
go party. We spent the rest of the night dancing our hearts out with complete
strangers for what seemed like four hours. Then we died. It was good.

I Mean, Really, How Relaxed Can One Person Be?- Mar 3
---
The lazy days continue as I woke up before most people, made some breakfast,
wrote a blog post, and waited for everyone else to wake up. We got our surf
crew together again, which included Brian, Nick, Jake, and Elliot, slathered on
some sunscreen, the first I had put on in a while, and headed for the beach.
Luckily we were able to rent boards and rash guards for the same price as the
last time so that meant that I didn't have to ruin a perfectly good long sleeve
shirt I was planning on wearing.

After a few quick tips from some friends I see occasionally, Sam from Vancouver
and Mathilde from Sweden, we paddled out to what looked to be a nice spot. We
were slightly left of completely wrong on our surf spot choice. The waves were,
how should I say it, fucking big. I would give them a conservative estimate of
almost two meters. Not quite the type of stuff you want to learn on I think.
We got our asses handed to us several times. The best part is if you try to
grab the first wave you find, it'll toss you. OK. No problem. However, as soon
as you pop your head up from getting thrown around like a rag doll, another
wave in the set is on it's way to do the same. This is exhausting. Once we
realized that the waves were too big for us, we paddled further left to
the learner's section of the surf. Here we mostly sat on our boards bereft of
spirit and precious energy. Only later did we notice that Jake had been on this
side for most of the hour, riding white wash and catching small, manageable
waves. Suffice it to say that I need some practice.

Nick and I went back to the hostel with avocado in hand and different guacamole
recipes in mind. We each used three avocados to make our respective batch.
When I opted for a simplistic avocado, tomato, onion, salt, and lime approach
Nick went for avocado, onion, cilantro, garlic, jalapeno, salt, and lime
design. Both options were eaten and no one wanted to give their opinion on
which was better and we were fine with that because Nick and I are friends.

I proceeded to take a nap.

I woke up feeling unbelievably groggy which was unexpected. I guess the surf
took more from me than I expected. We lollygaged for a bit and decided to go
to the craft beer bar for a drink. I guessed 90 pesos for an IPA and I was
right so instead, having only 120 pesos left in my budget for the day, I
decided that I would simply have pale ale. It was surprisingly good, though I
don't think it would hit my standards in Canada. I just haven't had a decent
beer in a while. We then acquired some meat and veggies for our stir fry
dinner. Cooking is a lot of fun in hostels and you save so much money. I spent
30 pesos on dinner which was a huge plate of vegetables, meat, rice, and
soy sauce. Perfect.

The rest of the night was spent finding a few extra pesos hidden in my clothes
and spending them on a couple relaxing beers with friends. Once the party up
on the hostel bar got a bit more rowdy I decided that I may as well get some
rest and be a bit more chipper the next day. I'm proud of myself for this
because a lot of the time I will stay awake or go out just to make sure I don't
miss anything from the night. But what the hell, I was tired, I went to sleep.
Makes sense to me. I got that lesson from Ida. Cheers ;)

The Most Worried I've Been for a Birthday Party - Mar 4
---
The day arrived. Mel turned 23. An Australian's birthday. Brace for impact.

For the most part, during the morning, I hung around after doing my morning
blog post ritual, which I'm starting to enjoy more and more these days. It's
nice and quite in the hostel in the morning because most people either sleep
late in general or are sleeping in late due to hangovers. Score for me and
whoever is working the hostel desk in the morning because they get to enjoy my
company. So, I did some more hanging around, Nick left for Guadalajara, I
expect I will be seeing him there if we can arrange it, and people got the
bright idea to go for one of those huge margaritas on the beach. Alright, I
didn't spend much money on breakfast because I'm budgeting well lately. Let's
do it.

Flash forward to about 2:30pm and a about six people are starting on their
second margarita. I wouldn't say it was a stupid idea but it was definitely the
start to their slippery slope of a night. I restrained myself with just one
so I could go surfing with Sascha. So, only the tiniest bit tipsy, we headed
back to the hostel.

**Interruption:** I forgot to mention meeting Geoff, the Austrailian Canadian,
the other day. Cool dude. Geoffs/Jeffs have to stick together despite the
spelling. Unless they spell it Geff, then they're on their own. Anyway, we've
hung out a bit and while I was chilling in the hostel as he came back from
surfing he told me I could use his 8ft foam surf board for free! Righteous!

Back to the story. Sascha and I ran into Cabiri who was with her friend Sam at
the hostel. Sam wanted in on the surfing so we waited and left together. At the
beach I saw Mathilde and Sam (a different one), the Swedish-Canadian couple.
Sam is from Vancouver but he has lived in Sweden for five years. The result of
this is that his accent is a little bit off. I would not have guessed he was
Vancouver at all. I think it's super cool. I want a messed up accent too.
To me it's a mark of adventure and culture transfer.

The surfing was alright. Hopefully everyone that was watching me saw my first
wave and not much else. I feel close to getting it down. I need to be mindful
and not try to push up when my hands are holding the sides of the board and I
need to commit a bit more to the jump up. So close. After surfing we began the
party. I was chatting with a Mexican dude staying in the hostel named Oasvaldo
and he told me that he and the girl he is traveling with will be leaving for
Guadalajara on the same day as me. Free ride, cha-ching! After cake and
birthday singing, Sascha and I headed to Cabiri's for a little party. We shared
some mezcal and laughs before the rest of the crew showed up from Lush. It was
fun night that ended up at Camaron, of course, the beach club that is famous
for its Friday nights. 

I understand that there is a surprising lack of photos in this post but I
haven't been mindful of my documentation. This blog has almost turned into a
journal so you'll just have to deal. I plan on taking a day to get some photos
of the town so you can look forward to that.

Here's a photo of my engineering tan.
