Mental Workout - Mar 9
---
As I said in the last post, I spent this day researching places that I wanted
to visit, culling that list down so I could spend more time in single
locations, and reevaluating what I actually want to achieve with the rest of my
trip.

It went pretty well. I'm still not completely sure what I'm doing but I do know
that I'm done with Guadalajara at this point. I know I want to visit
Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico City, Puebla, Puerto Escondido, San
Cristobal de las Casas, Campeche, Merida, and Cozumel before I leave for the
east coast of Canada. I realized that what happens between those places doesn't
matter that much at all. I'm too worried about missing out that I forget to
have fun with the experience of travel and meeting new people. No more of that.

After coming to this realization I sent out some requests for CouchSurfing and
went for dinner, a walk to the super market, and finally watched a movie. This
was one of the more productive days I've had even though I don't have a lot of
physical proof that I accomplished much.

First Couchsurfing Experience - Mar 10
---
Late wake up, some troubles with the shower and I was off, fully packed, on my
way to the bus station to go to Guanajuato. I got to the bus stop and decided
to grab a bite. At the restaurant, I got to chat with the waiter there until
my bagel arrived. Both he and the other waiter were surprised to see that I
wasn't wearing a heavy sweater as it was a fairly cold day for Guadalajara
standards. Lol, not even a little cold. After I ate, I got passed by two buses
and got on the wrong bus twice, I didn't ride them anywhere but I guess I got
the wrong info from the hostel.

The bus ride to Guanajuato was around four hours and I managed to get a lot of
reading done. However, the first movie to play in the bus was Fury, with Brad
Pitt. My roommates and I made a drinking game out of this movie at one point
last year so I had to watch it. It was a good idea. Since I know the movie
fairly well, the Spanish dub was easier to understand and follow. It's funny
because I can almost feel myself getting back into the Spanish speaking
mindset.

Once I arrived, I took a city bus to the *centro*, found a cafe, and waited for
Antonio to meet up with me. Even during my short walk through the city to the
cafe I could tell that I'm going to like this city. It has small streets, loads
of students, cool architecture, and a safe feeling. After a bite, Antonio took
me around the town a bit, we dropped my bags off at his house where he lives
with three roommates and then went out for a beer. Before arriving at the
bar he showed me one of the viewpoints of the city, super beautiful at night.
As we chat and walk I can see that I do like this city and that Antonio is
proud and passionate about this town. He's lived here for eight years and is
originally from Leon. We spent our time drinking beer and telling stories in
the bar and this CouchSurfing experience only gets better and better. Antonio
is kindly correcting my Spanish and being patient when I lack a few key words
in my vocabulary.

Looking good Guanajuato.

I'm excited to see what the city has to offer.

How To Tourist - Mar 11
---
I woke up around 8:30am to start my day. A little earlier than normal to start
the day but that's fine. First mission was to get some more oats and supplies
for breakfasts. No problem. Antonio told me about a supermarket nearby where I
could get what I needed but I forgot the location. He wasn't receiving my
WhatsApp messages so I just decided to go to centro and figure it out there.
After the 15 minute walk I struggled to find anything that I needed.
Eventually Antonio responded saying that the supermarket is quite close to his
house, not in centro. Great. More walking and I got my stuff, returned to the
house and broke my fast just after 10:30am. Again late but that doesn't matter
at all really. I did a little research into places to visit, made a custom map
to follow, and set out.

I spent most of the day looking at buildings and the city in general, taking
lots of photos, none of which will see the light of day because the photos
themselves are quite unexciting. Just Google it. I did a lot of walking, that
pretty much sums it all up.

OK, one picture. The inside of the university.

<center><img src="/img/guanajuato-uni.jpg"></center>

I got back to the house around 7pm and made plans
to grab some grub with Antonio after his workout around 9pm. Between the plan
making and food I was on Facebook and noticed that a friend that I met in
Sayulita, Nick, was actually in Guanajuato as well. We made plans for beers.

After dinner we met up with Nick, Antonio said goodbye because was going on a
trip out of town for a rock climbing course for two days. I then met a few of
Nick's friends and fellow CouchSurfer champions. I enjoy the culture of
CouchSurfing a lot already. So far, everyone is friendly and like minded in the
sense that they're looking to both get cheap accommodation and even more so
meet cool people who can show you the city and help get you engaged in the real
culture and life of the town you're visiting. It's so cool.

What started out as a few beers snowballed quite quickly into a 6am bed time.
We got there by bar hopping the town, meeting a Norwegian (I'm seeing more and
more of them as I go), and chatting with a few people, desperately trying to
take advantage of the increased confidence given to us by our drink choices.
It always works. I'm not sure if I just don't notice the mistakes or if I don't
make as many mistakes because I don't care if they come up. But one way or
another, most Mexicans seemed to be impressed when I tell them that I've been
studying Spanish alone for a little less than seven months. Go me!

Hard Core Listening Practice, Mines, and Jamming - Mar 12
---
After only a few hours sleep I woke up around 11am, a little groggy but
excited to see what the day had to offer. I had my delicious oats (I know I
say this a lot but they are so good) and headed to Teatro Juarez to meet up
with Nick and Gaston. Gaston is another CouchSurfer being hosted by Alejandra
who is also hosting Nick at the moment. We met up and went to the feminist
meeting that Alejandra had invited us to the night before. The purpose of the
talk seemed to be what you might expect, although I wasn't able to grasp every
word that the people uttered. Topics included equality, safe practices for
women when going out, abortion, rape, violence, and the like. I'd say I was
able to understand about fifty to sixty percent of the conversation which
lasted about two hours, not only a good opportunity to learn about things that
I should already know about but don't really and also perfect Spanish listening
practice.

After the meeting Nick and I went with a Spanish girl named Eva to a mine in
Valenciana, or at least I think that was the name. It was sort of cool but
probably not worth your time and money unless you are interested in that sort
of thing. I heard there was a more impressive and bigger mine somewhere else
but apparently it was being used for wedding photos or some malarky like that.

Suh, dude?

<center><img src="/img/suh-dude.jpg"></center>

After we returned from the mine we took Eva home and hung out at Alejandra's
place. Gaston and I jammed a bunch with his guitar and Alejandra's ukulele.
That guy is seriously talented on stringed instruments and also has a good
voice. Musicians. We traded off songs for a while as well. I pulled out
classics like Cry Me a River, Wait for the Moment by Vulfpeck (check them
out please, do yourself a favour), and Careless Whisper while he played
classic Argentinian tangos and sambas. I think he wins. During that experience
Gaston introduced me to *mate* which is a classic Argentinian drink. If you've
ever read or seen the movie about Che Guevara's travels through South America
you would have seen *mate*. It's important to note that this is a traditional
drink and there are rules. Some of the rules I heard were that you need to
drink your cup quickly, you can't move the straw that sits in the cup,
and only the first person to pour the hot water into the cup will pour the
water the entire time. The drink itself is not that flavourful, but it is
good and the idea of the tradition and rules make it better.

To cap off the night Alejandra made us some enchiladas with food we had bought
from the Hidalgo Market near her house. Spicy but good. Then I showed them all
of the words I had written down from the meeting early in the day which they
attended. Gaston read them out, some of which were just sounds I heard and not
actually words, and Alejandra and Gaston would explain what they were so I
could write them into my flashcard app Anki.

A Note About My Language Learning
----
A quick word about Anki. It is the best way to get vocabulary into your head,
at least on a written level. The basic idea is that it is flashcards. The way
I memorize a word is to make a flashcard with the Spanish word on the front,
I search for that word on Google Images, find a picture that I like that
reminds me of the word, it could be an actual picture of the word itself or
something random, and add that to the back of the flashcard with the English
equivalent. Sometimes, if necessary you can also add sound to the flashcard in
case the pronunciation is difficult. After that you let Anki handle the rest.

Anki uses a technique called spaced repetition to help you remember your
flashcards. The basic idea is that there is a graph. On the X axis you have
time, on the Y you have a percentage representation of how well you can
remember a given word. When you review a word your ability to remember that
word is 100%. After, say, a few hours, this percentage dips and by the next
day your ability has dropped significantly. What Spaced Repetition Systems
(SRSs) do to help you remember is manage when you see your flashcards. When
reviewing the cards you tell Anki whether you didn't remember it, your
remembered it, or you remembered it easily. Based on this information, the
next time Anki will show you the card will be based on the settings you've
given it. For me, if I don't remember a word I will be asked about it 10
minutes later. After that if I remember it normally I will be asked in 1
hour, 2 hours, and finally 4 hours before it switches to one day. Then the next
time you review the card, if you get it right, it will increase the number of
days before the next time you need to review that word, always keeping your
ability to remember that word in a optimal spot for later usage. I highly
recommend you try this app if you're trying to learn anything that can be
written down on a flashcard. My vocabulary is good. The only problem I have
is that I don't go out of my way to use the new words I'm reviewing during
the day and that would make it easier to actually get them out of my mouth.

I've only recently been adding pictures to my flashcards and this has
surprised me with how much it helps with retention. An example. The word
*congelar* means to freeze in Spanish. Here is the photo I used to remember
this word:

<center><img src="/img/han-solo-carbonite.jpg"></center>

And no, I didn't have to look that up just in case I was wrong. Other examples
of pictures I use are Jafar from Aladdin for the word *malvado* meaning evil
and a picture of the wrestler The Undertaker for *emprender* which means to
undertake. There are some apps like Memrise that use this same technique to
help you learn. While I haven't tried Memrise, but plan to for French which
I will probably start learning close to next year, I think the power of this
technique with Anki is that searching for a custom image for a flashcard
actually contributes to your memorization of the word you're working on. The
down side is that you have to put in the work which for me is no problem
because learning Spanish is my number one goal right now. It takes less than
thirty seconds to find an image and put it into Anki if you've got a solid
internet connection. I learned about this technique from a book called
*Fluent Forever* and if you're interested in language learning I would
recommend reading it. It goes into way more detail about how we learn
languages and a bunch more methods on how to do it. A good read for aspiring
linguists and language learners alike.

More Tradition and Saunas - Mar 13
---
Nothing happened in the morning today. Let's just leave it at that. I met up
with the gang around 1pm in the afternoon and we went to the *temazcal.* At
this point I think you might want to just Google what that is for yourselves.

OK here's a link [temazcal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temazcal).

It seemed to me to be a traditional Mexican sauna experience. The experience
includes four, or in our case five, sessions of intense steam, singing, and
relaxation. Upon entering, you may wear whatever you want or nothing if it
suits your fancy. You first apply mud to your body but I don't remember if
the woman leading us told us why. Quick tip, don't put any above your eyes
because you'll be sweating a lot throughout the course of this experience and
any mud that gets in your eyes will probably sting. I learned that the hard
way. We then got some jamaica tasting tea which was rather nice. A so began
the session.

If you want a more intense experience you stand up in the sauna, heat rises
so, you know, it'll be hotter the higher you go. During each session we were
in almost complete darkness save for some small holes in the sauna itself
and the leader's glowing watch. The leader told us about relaxing,
breathing deeply, and relaxing. She then banged a empty water cooler
container as a drum and the group sang some Mexican tunes. The session ends
and the door is opened to allow cold-ish air and light in. Some chatting
and spiritual talk which, to be honest, is a little outside of my
understanding and the next session begins. Just before the last session
we were given a mixture of salt, mint, spearmint, and some other herbs whose
smell was only surpassed by the feeling it gives when you apply it to your
skin. Incredibly refreshing after three sessions of steam. A few more
sessions and by the end of it there were people screaming with excitement
and who knows what. It was pretty intense but eventually relaxing. At the
end you wash yourself and pay. If you would like to hear more about this
experience just ask me the next time we see each other. It was worth the
150 pesos but I'm not sure I'll be going out of my way to do it again.

After that we bought some food, made dinner, and relaxed. It seemed that time
passed a bit quicker than any of us thought. Part of the group went for coffee
and later pizza and mezcal. That is how I spent the day. It wasn't much, but
it was cool. Good day.

Looking cooking Mexicans! Though some people were Spanish and probably
something else. You get the idea.

Suh Dude? - Mar 14
---
Today felt like it went by slowly because we didn't do much. I woke up a bit
earlier than normal, must have slept well, and got my stuff together to do
laundry. Since my CouchSurfing (CS) host had a washing machine but no dryer
I decided to do laundry with Nick. We met at the market and did that. Then we
went for a little food at the La Paz Cafe. We then went to Alejandra's place
to hang out while we waited for our clothes. Alejandra went to work and I
tried for a time to learn a little bit more about the Spanish subjunctive.
All I know now for sure is that it is hard to get a grasp on. Nick had a nap,
I played some guitar and then Gaston made us some spaghetti. Do you think
I'm going into too much detail about this stuff?

Nick and I went to the bar that Alejandra works at to have a drink and say
goodbye. Some flavoured meszcal shots later and we were on our way.
Nick and I grabbed our laundry and I somehow lost one of the insoles I use
for my Tom's shoes. The reason I have them is so I don't stick up the shoes
themselves and wash the insoles when necessary. Oh well, I should be able to
buy some more in Mexico City. We then went to our respective CS houses, packed
up, did one check at the laundromat for my insole and went to the bus station.
Unfortunately, Nick missed his bus for Mexico City and had to wait until
6:30pm. For me, it was easy. There is a bus from Guanajuato to San Miguel de
Allende every so often. When my bus arrived we said goodbye and promised to
see each other where Nick will be teaching English for three months. I'll get
back there at some point before my trip. I've got some friends to impress
with my improved Spanish skills.

See you later, Nico!

The bus was short. The hostel is comfy and cheap. The city is beautiful at
night. I found some decently cheap tacos though I expect I can find some for
less than the 20 pesos I paid.

*Hasta la vista*



*baby.*


I had to.
