A Bit of the Day Before - Mar 31
---
Once we (we being me, Dini, and Fiona the two Australian girls headed to
Guatemala) arrived in San Cristobal de las Casas, we headed straight to the
market, a fairly famous reason to visit the city. The market was cool, as most
markets are and it's also quite a walk even though we didn't see it all. One
thing that I hadn't seen before though it did not surprise me was seeing a
bunch of elderly woman walking around with live chickens, holding them by
their feet so they're upside. They were completely calm, at least it seemed.
After the market we got some coffee because apparently this city is also
famous for its coffee. I got a cappuccino as it was recommended from the
waiter. It was good, but I'm not one who likes coffee so my opinion is
most likely worthless. We got the coffee at Cafe Bar Revolucion, again, a
famous place in the city. We got some *pan elote* which we discovered is
basically sweetcorn bread. Tasty.

We relaxed at the hostel for quite a while and then decided to go out to the
towns *mirador* or viewpoint to catch the sunset. We arrived at Don Lauro's
house and were greeted by Juan who seemed to be a man who maintained the Don's
land. This had a bit of a weird vibe to it as Juan told us he would accompany
us up the mountain (it was a hill) to meet with Don Lauro. After about 25
minutes of walking upwards we arrived, though Juan got distracted by someone
else who was coming up the mountain as well so we went on without him. Here's
a photo:

Unfortunately Google didn't stitch the panorama together for me so I did a
quick early morning stitch job in GIMP. Sorry not sorry.

It was a little disappointing to be honest, but only because the sunset was
blocked by another hill peek. Oh well, you win some you lose some. After
descending down the hill I had a successful phone conversation with the taxi
driver that brought us to the hill. He told me he would be five minutes. Liar.
We walked down to a *panaderia* for some treats and hailed a cab from the main
street. We eventually found some two peso tacos in the now almost abandoned
market which were basically worth two pesos. The portions were small but
there's something about getting a two peso taco that makes you want more.
That pretty much concluded our night.

The Canyon, or is it The River? - Apr 01
---
I woke up at 6:20am to say goodbye to the girls who were off to Guatemala. I
woke up again at 8:40am in a panic because I was suppose to get a bus to the
canyon tour at 9:00am. Little did I forget that this is Mexico. My bus arrived
at 9:42am and we went off.

The canyon was pretty cool, though I was almost too concerned with my lack
of sunscreen that I may have missed some things that I shouldn't have. It's
alright though because I didn't miss them, don't worry. Here are some of the
more important/interesting photos:

We spent one hour in the town square where I sat back and relaxed, proud of
the fact that I managed to avoid the sun enough to not be in pain. Once back
in town I sat down in one of the leather couches in the hostel and began
doing as little as possible as I could. I spent a good five hours in that
seat looking at things, studying a bit of Spanish. The usual. It was a nice
relaxing time. I managed to figure out my schedule for the next month which
includes a visit to Campeche (maybe Isla Mujeres) and three revisits to
Merida, Cozumel, Mexico City (third time in this town), and Sayulita. I'll
stay in Mexico until after Cinco de Mayo, of course, because that is going to
be amazing. After that I'll fly over to St. John's, Newfoundland or somewhere
close to the east coast. That part of the trip has almost zero plans at this
point.

OK, if I get the time on Saturday night I promised that I would write a blog
post in Spanish without using the internet or any dictionaries to see where
my written Spanish is at. That should be fun.

Relaxing and Taking Photos - Apr 02
---
My original plan for this day was to relax and take photos, as you may have
thought. Things did not go exactly as I had planned them. Yeah. That.
I met a group of people that had been travelling together for the last little
while and we all decided that, after breakfast, we would go watch the
Barcelona vs Madrid soccer game over lunch and a some drinks. Sounds good.
The problem with this plan, however, is that I began hanging out with some
people that had just told me that all they had been doing in San Cristobal was
drink, party, and repeat. So what actually happened was a nice lunch waiting
various poor quality soccer streams with some beer followed by a larger amount
of time spent just having more beer.

Afteward we went back to the hostel to relax and play some pool. That part
went fine because we were all ready to listen to my Latin music playlist which
includes such hits as Volverte a Ver by Juanes and other countless reggaeton
tunes that get your hips moving. As we played we met a few Canadian girls that
said they were going to the wine place that I had suggested as a place to
spend the end of the night after a pizza place I had found in the Mexico book.
Cool. Turned out that the rest of the crew went somewhere, I don't remember
where. So it was just me and the Danish dude, Hjatle, that went to the wine
place. Turns out there were four Canadian girls who were all teaching English
in Monterray, a place I neglected to visit. We had a great time chatting
about, take a guess. Gone on. Go ahead.

LANGUAGES!!!! Yes!!!

Here's a picture of the Dane and one of the Canadians, Kim.

And a poor attempt someone took at capturing my likeness. Let's call this a
wine filter.

![Blurred Jeff](/img/wine-blurred-jeff.jpg)

It must have been Hjalte because he took a few selfies too.

Later on, after paying I realized I didn't have the pesos to pay my share of
the wine between Hjalte and I. The two of us went to the ATM as the girls
went back to the hostel. Long story short, the ATMs didn't work for me and I
owe a Danish man some money. Back at the hostel there was some live music and
a party. I called it in early as I had been sipping alcoholic beverages for
almost 13 hours straight. Blah.

Recovery - Apr 03
---
Oh. God. Wine. Why? Just why?

I spent my morning hanging with the same crew of people as the day before
though this time around we were all in a bit more of a chilled out mood if
you get my meaning. We grabbed some goat meat and soup at a place a long walk
away from the hostel which was good but I don't think goat is my favourite
meat. As the crew filed out of the hostel I decided to take a nap, I was
so out of it. Three hours later and I woke up with a slightly bigger headache
and a crink in my neck. Honestly, so great. Sometimes I wonder if this is the
reason I went travelling, whether or not this information should be in a blog
or more of a private diary, and how I even managed to drink that amount. These
are the bigs questions that I'm contemplating these days.

With the rest of my day I staggered around, got some food, and ended the night
with some computer time and a movie. Meh.

Waterfalls, Lakes, and Unfavourable Weather - Apr 04
---
I had booked myself a tour through the Montebello Lakes and the Chiflon
Waterfalls so I got up nice and early even though, again, I'm working on
Mexican time which means you basically have about 20-30 minutes of time to
spare when you're doing something. Anyway, the two German dudes in my room
were up even early which made me think they were doing the same thing as me.

The trip to the Chiflon Waterfalls took a little over two hours. It was a
quiet car ride. Not that I would break the silence were it Canada, but I still
don't break silence in Spanish. Dang. The waterfalls were pretty cool and once
you get to the big one at the end it is quite impressive. At least by my
standards. Here are a few snaps.

![Waterfall 03](/img/waterfall-03.jpg)

What? It was sunny and I had some bed-head. OK?

At the end of the waterfall I met up with the Germans that are in my room.
It turns out that they did wake up for the same reason, just through a
different company. We had a quick chat for a bit. Then I had a quick chat with
a guy in my group that is from Guanajuato which is cool because I liked that
city quite a lot. But more importantly, Spanish!

We stopped for lunch at the same spot as the Germans' tour group and neither
I nor the Germans wanted to have lunch there so chatted for the entire lunch
outside the restaurant. They're both 19 but you were never guess by looking at
them because they're both pretty big dudes. One of them gave me the name of
this university that is going to attend that has some weird hat and a long
list of rules on how to wear and use this hat. I think it was bull shit but
I haven't done the research yet. In case you're curious the name of the
university is Fachhochschule Rosenheim holztechnik. Good luck.

Later we arrived at the first lake that is actually called *Cinco Lagos*. I'll
leave the translation out of that one for you. Out of respect for your
intellect. The group was given the run down of the raft tour prices and me
and the Guanajuatan, along with an older lady decided to opt out because the
weather was getting worse and the price wasn't appealing enough. While we
waited for the rest of our group to go out, we chatted together and also with
a tour guide about this and that. Good stuff.

We then went to the remaining lakes that are famous for the fact that they are
so close together but none of them has the same colour. Me and the Guanajuatan
decided the colours were blue, green, and cafe. Sure. We visited one more
lake but there wasn't much to be seen. We spent ten minutes at that one.

Here are the best shots of the lakes and such.

The tour got back to town at just past 9pm so I grabbed my pizza from the day
before. Shared a game of pool with Sam, the Honduran hostel worker, ate some
of the potatoes he offered me after I gave him a slice of pizza, and went to
bed. Despite my physical state it was a pretty good day.

What'd I Miss, Get It! - Apr 05
---
Since I hadn't spent a lot of time actually exploring the city itself I
decided to give it the old walk about. I didn't take many photos of this stuff
but you could easily Google any of this stuff. I'm assuming it's fairly
standard issue San Cristobal. Places I visited included Museo de Medicina
Maya, Museo del Ambar, Arco Torre del Carmen, and a church up a hill. I spent
the rest of my day chilling in the hostel until my bus for Campeche.

Yet another night bus, here we go. The bus took four hours longer than
scheduled. I don't remember why exactly. I just remember hearing that we
needed to make a return for some reason at some point. This was probably one
of the worst ones so far. My neck was still sore for whatever reason, I
couldn't managed to get to sleep for quite a long time, we stopped in Palenque
which seems fine but they made everyone get out of the bus so it could be
cleaned for around 20 minutes. The only up side of the extra time was that
it meant we would get to Campeche at the reasonable hour of 8:30am instead of
4:30am.
