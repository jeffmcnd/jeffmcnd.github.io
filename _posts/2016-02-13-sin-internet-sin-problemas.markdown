Reconnecting with The Brothers LeFevre and More Powell Riverite-onians - Feb 2
---
After my flight from Mexico City to San Jose del Cabo I met up with Mack in the
airport. Man, it's amazing seeing people from home here in Mexico. We hopped in
his Delica, which he, his wife, Jasmine, and their dog drove down from Powell
River and arrived at the first campsite of my trip. As promised, Leif, Jan, Jas
and the dog, Pipa were all there waiting to greet me. This place is pretty cool
but having arrived around dark, the night didn't last long before bed. 

The Fateful Fall Of February - Feb 3
---
The morning of Wednesday we were met with lovely clear skies and decided to go
for a trek up the river that exists in the middle of what I would classify as
a desert. The water was extremely cold but did not deter us from exploring to
our hearts content. We reached a few spots were there was some cliff diving so
I went for it. After jumping in, I decided to try and rock climb my way back up
to the top for another go. This was a bad idea. I fell. I crashed. I hit. I
hurt. As a rock climber I know how to fall so all the damage was superficial.
I scraped arm, a tiny cut on my big toe, and a few other toes that went numb.
Honestly, it wasn't even as bad as the pain of walking barefoot on rocks.

We then headed back down, I attempted no more cliff jumps and rock climbing
and we set off for the real campsite after packing up our current situation.
A short ride later and we arrived a Los Frailes, a small beach community filled
with Mexican fisherman and, at first glass, Mexican campers. Upon close
inspection, however, you realize that the campers are indeed North American
visitors that spend a lot of time in the sun. We set up camp and proceeded to
do what we would do for the next seven or so days and nights: swam, drank, ate,
snorkeled, napped, read, slept, and adventured.

Losing Track of Time, Days, and Self - Feb 4 to 10
---
I'm going to go ahead and meld this week into one section as we didn't vary our
days that much during the visit. Some highlights are as follows:

- we read a ton of books
- when you're going off the sun, you go to bed at dark and wake at first light
- skinny dipping is a thing
- the Powell River crew has a friend named Bernie that lives there, he's cool
- snorkeling is fun
- I can't use a spear gun properly
- Mack caught a fish with said spear gun
- we managed to get by with a surprisingly small amount of sunscreen
- I didn't know I could sleep in a hammock for an entire night
- I want to buy some sort of camping/livable vehicle and travel at some point

All of these highlights were dispersed between the regular activities
of beer, tequila, swimming, sleeping, napping, siestas, staying in the shade,
and making a lot of puns. Here's a picture of our campsite and Jan.

These days were the most relaxing of the trip. I didn't have to worry about a
bus to catch, where I was going to sleep, or fumble through trying to speak
Spanish, though I do want to do that. I can't thank Mack and Jass enough for
carrying an extra tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping mat in their vehicle and
also for driving me around. Thank you so much! I will visit you in Powell River
for some of that honey dijon ice cream Leif was trying to get you to make!

First Day of Actual Solo Travel and This Happens - Feb 11
---
The morning came a little bit too quickly if you ask me. Especially when you
get out of your hammock because you heard the German Shepherd size (allegedly)
coyotes chewing something near you, retreating to your tent in the
middle of the night. After rubbing our eyes Jan, Leif, and I packed up our
stuff, said goodbye to Pipa who had just began warming up to us and Jass who
may have just done the same, who knows. We dropped off Jan and Leif at the
airport as they are going home to Powell River, then continued to Cabo San
Lucas where I would be staying for a few nights.

Mack and I hung out after I checked in, standing in lines at the Telcel to fix
his phone up, buying candy, and soon after enjoyed an ice coffee each at a
Wifi enabled cafe. We then parted ways as we neared my hotel with a good hug.

I spent the rest of the day wandering around, turning down "massages", checking
out the beach, the resorts, the Americans, and the docks. I got back to the
hotel, met my roommates, both from Mexico City so we spoke in Spanish and hung
out until they left for dinner and drinks. I left a little later as I had some
trip planning to do. I figured out that I'll be going to La Paz for two nights
and then Puerto Vallarta for four nights, enough to time to see the city and
also have two day trips to other small villages near there. I booked my hostels
and plane ticket and then headed out for dinner. After dinner, I walked around
enough to end up in a bar. It's here that I met Jay and Carey (or CC, they
haven't agreed on what the first C stands for yet). They live in Oregon and are
doing a van trip for kite surfing, surfing, and general fun. We had a blast
chatting and drinking. I did make one crucial mistake during our time in the
bar, however. The mistake was thinking that the "special" they were drinking
which appeared to be a beer and a shot of tequila, were for each person, so I
ordered one. The problem is that the special was actually two beers and two
shots of tequila. Woops.

We left the bar and went into a variety of clubs, dancing, singing, and talking
about our adventures. At one point I got to see their van, it's exactly what
I expected, a van with a bed, a dog, running water, a type of kitchen area,
solar panels, the works. After realizing it was 3am, we quickly exchanged
Facebook info and parted ways. When I got back to the hotel I realized that
there was any way that I would be able to get into the room without waking my
roommates so I thought, screw it there are lounge chairs over here, I'll sleep
on one of those. I woke up at 4am and that's when the fun began.

Wasted Day? Maybe - Feb 12
---
The fun I mentioned earlier manifested itself in a few visits to the bathroom
and a ton of time lying in bed feeling sorry for myself. I was eventually able
to move enough to go into town and try for lunch, I couldn't bear it well so
I had it wrapped up to go. After a little longer in bed I figured a swim in the
beach would do me some good. After the dip, I read a little bit and went back
to the hotel. I spent the rest of the night on my computer, looking up things
to do at the places I would be visiting and trying to put into practice some
of the learning techniques I'd read about in one of the language books I have.

As far as this day goes, I hope to not put myself in that kind of position
again but who knows what will happen. The next paragraph was written yesterday
but it didn't seem appropriate to put it at the end of the "I drank too much"
paragraph.

Closing Thoughts - Feb 13
---
Now I'm actually traveling solo. It hasn't sunk in quite yet even as I sit here
booking hostels and plane tickets without consulting the opinion of my friends.
When I started my travels I made immediate friends through my old roommate,
Tyler. After that, Jan and Leif showed up. During a quick break in Acapulco I
was accompanied still by my Mexican friend Gonzalo. Upon arriving in Los Cabos
I immediately joined up with Mack, Jass, Jan, and Leif. But now, now I'm
completely on my own and while it's a bit unnerving, I know that I'm about to
have an amazing amount of experiences. These experiences may range from planned
to spontaneous, amazing to underwhelming, or lucky to stupid but I know this:
This has been and will continue to be an unprecedented amount of fun.

Here's what five weeks of Mexico looks like on me. Until the next one.
