Lost in Translation - June 01
---
This morning I spent a good amount of time chatting with Niclas and Pooria
about a variety of topics. After we finished the conversation I headed out
on yet another walk around the city. I'm beginning to think that I'll injure
myself if I keep this kind of physical activity up for too long.

First on the list was bagels at Farimount. Worth the walk, but the best
bagel was off course the fresh sesame seed bagel. Go check them out. With
that said, however, I'm realizing that I'm not blown away by food
recommendations these days. Sure, the food is delicious, but I'm not having
any epiphanies because of them. Anyway, good bagels are good. I then walked
around Place des Artes, Quartier des Spectacles, and the surrounding area.
This is a varied city and everything I saw was cool. It is deifinitely a
downtown. I can for sure say that. After wondering for a time I began the
search for the Black's Photography store where I would surely find the
answer to my camera woes. I got to the cross street I had jotted down earlier
but had no luck finding the place. I walked into the bank building and
asked someone where the store was located and she told me that it closed a
while ago. Damnit, Google Maps, why didn't you tell me!

I sat down, sadly, in the courtyard for a short while before going to
Crescent Street where I was promised bars, restaurants, and English speakers.
I decided to sit down for some late lunch and beers to drown my sorrows.
I managed to sneak in a couple chapters of HP during my two beers and fish
and chips and headed out again. I decided it was time to go back to the
apartment as I was getting tired again, probably still a bit worn out from
the day before, and also a bit sore in the foot region.

I met up with Pooria and Niclas, chatted with Nick for a bit and then
Pooria's boyfriend, Matthieu, showed up and we headed for dinner. Niclas and
I finally spoke Spanish and both he and Pooria were impressed with my
accent and ability. Yay! I do like a bit of praise, but not too much. I'm
still no good at taking compliments. After dinner we walked around and
I convinced everyone to come get a hot chocolate at Cacao 70, a place Pooria
had suggested on my first night. We continued our chats. We went through
Swedish, French, English, Spanish, and even some German. Of course, since
Niclas and Pooria are the polyglots they did most of the heavy lifting here
but the whole night was a huge reinforcement of my love for languages and
learning them. So cool to be around so interesting sounds, accents, and
expressions. I can't wait until I can do the same! But I think I may have
mentioned this before. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Rain Makes Your Cares Go Away - June 02
---
Today it was rainging. Everyone was out of the apartment before me and then
I too decided to depart. I tried to drive down to Verdun and see some
things but the traffic to get out of downtown was abismal. I came close to
overheating my car a quite a few occasions. I dilly-dallied (spelling?) for
a while at a grocery store somewhere and decided to call it a day. I hit
traffic a second time, this time seeing some vapour come from under the
hood of the car. I stopped to let it cool and then went back to the
apartment. We spent the rest of the day doing next to nothing. I watched a
movie and did some language learning research. Mostly, I'm thinking about the
language I would like to learn after Swedish, if I end up getting that far.
Hindi is an extremely strong competitor because of it's unusual script and
it's number of native speakers. Other candidates are Arabic and Russian but,
of course, I can't make any decisions at this point. I don't even know if
I'll get through French. It's all just a plan. That's all it ever is.

I Missed Engineers, But Not Hangovers - June 03
---
I spent the morning hanging out with Pooria and Niclas while I did my
laundry and made plans to leave for Ottawa. Niclas left on his expedition
for the day so we said goodbye. Pooria told me about all the cool festivals
and events coming up in Montreal, most notably of which, Just For Laughs,
that I would be missing this year. Which is fine because I've been missing
them for my entire life but it does kind of seem like I could spend a bit
more time in this city if I wanted to. But I'm kind of OK with leaving.

After my clothes were finished I handwrote out my directions to Doug's
place and the bar he said I could meet him at and headed out. The beginning
of the drive was poor as I had some difficulties, as per usual, with all
of the signage in the city. I ended up doing a couple rounds of a small
section of town, giving up and just following things for "Toronto" which
turned out perfect and got me back on my charted course. I arrived in
the Ottawa section of the highway in about two hours and was greated by
some insane traffic. Luckily my car didn't over heat and I made it to
The Brew Table to meet Doug and his friends Mac, Lynn, and Ryan.

I missed engineering humour. It was a blast. We had a couple of beers,
Ryan took off, and the rest of us went to get some food at a place called
The Butchery. Tasty. We grabbed some beer from the LCBO, Mac departed, and
Doug, Lynn, and I went to Dougs to hang out. There I received the Nexus 5
that my friend, Dan (you goddamn legend) sent me as a backup for my broken
phone. I can't believe anyone actually took me seriously, let alone the
fact that I had a couple of friends offer to send a phone half way across
the country just to make my trip a little less difficult. You people are
awesome. A few more bad jokes, some talk about travel and life and two more
of Doug's friends showed up, Owen and Adam. So many engineers.

Later on in the night we went to a place called The
Lieutenant's Pump. It's a deceptively large pub with lots of room for
regular pub activities such as standing and drinking, sitting and drinking,
dancing and drinking, and the like. It was a fun night that ended around
4am. Not sure how many of those I've got in me for this trip. But definitely
a few more.

A Walk About Town with A Friend - June 04
---
After Doug and I had breakfast and semi-planned the day we headed out
together on a walking tour of Ottawa. We saw basically it all. Parliament,
Rideau Canal, the market down the road from Parliament, a mall, Clarence
Street where they are obsessed with patios, lots of old building, a small
festival, and then a beer festival. Ottawa is a cool city and I like beer
festivals.

I enjoyed seeing the architecture that a lot of the buildings have to offer
but it is becoming a bit stale having spent the last five months travelling.
The beer fest was a lot of fun, we tasted eight different IPAs in order
to vote for a our favourite. Then we hit a liquor store because Doug had
told me about some concoction of wine and Coca-Cola that I had to try. When
we got back from the day out we had goals to meet again with some of Doug's
friends but it kind of fell through so I made the mistake of starting to
watch Game of Thrones because I haven't been keeping up. Three episodes,
some Kalimotxo (the wine drink), and some shawarma later and it was time
to get some sleep while Doug's new air conditioner was bushing some glorious
cold air into the room.

It was a good day and we plan on going to see Gaitneau park tomorrow which
should also be good.

It Rained, Like A Lot - June 05
---
We had planned on seeing Gatineau Park today and those plans were quickly
fooled by the ridiculous amount of rain that we got. Something about a nice
walk/hike in a park with a few friends doesn't seem satisfying when you're
getting drenched. Instead, we headed to parliament to get tickets for a
tour. We got our tickets and had some spare time before the tour started so
we decided to check out the Supreme Court. The courst is pretty cool, mostly
in the fact that it's a significant building. There's not much else to it.
We learned a little bit about the nine justices that reside, how often
they sit, who decides how many justices sit, etc. We almost got the third
and final presentation done, however, they presented it in English and
neither of us are proficient enough to translate. We left for our tour.

The tour of parliament was pretty cool. We saw lots of dark rooms, lots of
paintings, lots of sculptures, the top of the clock tower, and even the
room where #elbowgate happened! I enjoyed the tour. I plan on going to see
a question period in The House of Commons before I leave, just to see
firsthand how our MPs act during the debates. Granted, you can watch them
online but I figure what the hell, I'm here.

After the tour there was not much left to do with the town. I thought my
days would have been a bit more hectic in Ottawa but much to my pleasant
surprise they are going rather smoothly with few worries. Cool. We spent
pretty much the rest of the day looking up parliamentary things, proccesses,
memes, and other stuff, finishing off with some more episodes of Game
of Thrones so I would be caught up.

Gatineau Park - June 06
---

Another late start to the day after seeing Doug off for work in order to
grab the keys for his apartment and I decided today would be a good day for
Gatineau Park. So, for the first time since I received the life saving
phone from my friend, Dan, I was able to punch "Gatineau Park" into Google
Maps and be guided by a soothing computer voice to my destination. It was
pure amazement. It was like the first time I had ever used this technology.
We're so spoiled.

First, I went to Pink Lake. Here are a couple photos:

Oh yeah, did I mention that my camera started working for no reason the
other day while I was having lunch with Doug? Yeah, that's a thing that
happened. I have no idea what changed. I was trying to show Doug that my
camera was broken, even if you tried to take a photo during video mode. I
took a picture and it worked. I don't know, and I don't care. I have a nice
camera again. That's what matters.

The walk around the lake took me a little while but it was peaceful. I
appreciate peaceful these days. The rest of the time in Gatineau Park was
spent driving around random roads, taking turns for things that sounded
interesting, and stopping at the top of some hill's lookout to take a few
moments to do nothing. I also came across some "ruins" which are from some
abbey that somebody built a long time ago. They're pretty uninetersting.
But they exist. Now you know.

I went back to the apartment at some hour before Doug got home so I could let
him in and give him back his keys. We spent the night doing little, I watched
the last two episodes of Silicon Valley that I had left, and prepared the
latest episode of Game of Thrones. We got large amounts of sushi at a
restaurant we probably took too long to find and decide on and came back to
the place to watch Thrones. The show is still good, it turns out. I had no
doubts. But I wonder if I should have gone and binged them like I always
do. It is extremely easy to fall back into old habits, sometihng that I do
quite effortlessly, which is a bit upsetting, considering I have been doing
different things almost every day during this trip. I would prefer to bring
in new habits that are more productive that unearth old habits that see me
spending hours in one spot, watching a TV or computer screen, and taking
into content that doesn't help me learn anything other than how to chat
with people about a show or spoil a show. I mean, I won't stop watching my
favourite shows but doing it in one go feels like a bad idea.

Any way, parliament tomorrow for question period should be good. Not
underwhelming or upsetting at all.

Parliament and The Limestone City - June 07
---
I got my act together a little earlier than normal today. I headed up to
the parliament building and asked when I would need to arrive to get a seat
during question period in The House of Commons, and then made my way up
to 24 Sussex, where the Prime Minister is supposed to live, though I hear
JT doesn't currently reside there. I then headed in Rideau Hall for a 45
minute tour. It's pretty cool to see the things that our government uses
on a regular basis in real life as opposed to TV. I remember the tour guide
telling us to remember one year. 1848. There I remembered. I couldn't tell
you what it was about, but there you have it. Wait, I just Googled it. I
think I got that wrong. Shit.

After the tour I walked back to parliament, had lunch and got in line. The
line was fairly long due to a school group but after the saftey check I
was in the room where you wait to be seated. This place seems extremely
unorganized. Not something you want to see when your opinion of government
is that it should be well run and organized. At any rate, I wasn't able
to get a seat during question period because they were full of people with
reservations. You can reserve a seat if you get in touch with your MP, by
the way. Something I probably should have done. Oh well.

I got back to Doug's place and sat down to watch a bit of question period
online. Turns out JT was there but the 20 minutes I watched had little to
do with things that interest me. The questions were loaded or childish which
seems to be the norm. It's awfully surprising how these question periods
are performed. At times the house is completely shouting, the responses do
almost nothing to actually answer the question, the second question that is
asked after the first rebuttle is basically just slander, and the second
response is a repetition. It doesn't seem helpful. Whatever, I'm sure they'll
get stuff done. After that, I packed up my things and hit the road to
Doug's work. I dropped off his keys, had a hug goodbye and a promise to see
each other at our friend's wedding in a month and a bit and I was off
to the gas station for a fill up of gas and oil.

A couple hours later and I arrived in Kingston. I took a drive around The
Royal Military College because it had been suggested to me. I also took a
quick walk up to the closed door of For Henry, neat. Then I did a lengthy
walk through Queen's University, through buildings and beside the street,
and also along the water for a bit. Then it was time to eat/drink. I found
the main street, Princess, good one, and came across a busy, neat looking,
brewpub called Stone City Ales. I decided to stay, I got some beers, their
IPA is quite nice. It was then that I realized I could do little reviews of
craft breweries across Canada and bring them back to the people I know
at The Great Canadian Beerfest in Victoria. So, hopefully next year we'll
see Stone City Ales there.

I spent a good amount of time chatting with the three bartenders/servers and
got some info on the brewery, the town, and Jasper of all places. It was
good. I got some frozen yogurt afterwards, talked with the guy working there
who was actually the owner about the affect of the huge road construction
going on had on business and got back to my car. I found the nearest Walmart
and got myself set up. While I don't enjoy sleeping in my car, it is free.
