Cabot Trail - May 20
---
This morning Bob and I spent most of our time getting things together so we
could both leave. After a some shuffling around, a little bit of internet
searching for how to get to Sydney and The Cabot Trail we were both fully
packed and heading out the door. I gave Bob a hand shake and a hug in the
elevator and we parted ways. It was manly, unemotional, respectful, and
cool I assure you. After I dropped my bags off with Ivy, I got directions
to the nearest place to buy fabric for the privacy curtains that I hope to
install in the car. I went into Fabricville and got some advice, fabric,
needles, and thread from one of the women working there. She taught me how
I could fold the fabric over a string/rope and sew it together like a real
curtain. I feel like a real now.

Then I got a donair as instructed by Bob. Good stuff. After that I started
the actual roadtrip! Ther wasn't much to see until I actually got on the
right road for the trail so let's just skip a few hours. I found the first
beach and the sand was actual sand, not rocks or loarge pebbles. It was
just like Mexico except it was still cold and there were no people. Stil
beautiful. Still a nice stop. I then stopped at a grocery store for
directions to the nearest camp spot/place where I could sleep and was
directed down the road a little further and down to a beach. I had to go
past a house that is fairly close to the beach so I'm a bit worried I'm
going to be kicked out but let's hope for the best.

Good news! I can lay flat out in the back of Ivy (maybe I shouldn't always
use the car's name in place of the word "car") if I do some adjustments
including moving the front seats forward, using my bakcpacks as space fillers
so there is no drop off where my head rests and voila! A bed. I'm having
trouble containing the excitement I've got for this roadtrip. I'm sitting
in a warm cozy bed looking at the sunset on the ocean on a fairly quiet
night. I will admit, there are some drunk people down the beach making
noise but it is nothing I haven't dealt with before. Tomorrow I'll rise
with the sun or wake up when it's too hot in the car and continue on.
Here we go!

Here's a video explaining the setup and showing off my frist car camping
location.

Wildlife and Tent Setup - May 21
---
I woke, as expected, nice and early from my slumber in the car at about
6:00am. I managed to get back to sleep for a extra needed hour and went
about having breakfast, yogurt from the day before that was left outside
of the car to keep it refrigerated, oats, and a banana. It never tasted
so good. After breakfast I made my way to the Cabot Trail information
center where I waited with a fellow traveler, originally from Toronto that
now lives in Halifax, for the the center to open so I could purchase my
park pass. $7.60, that's under budget for the day, cool. After learning that
most campsites charge around $20 for a night I realized that I would have
to get a little bit clever with my where I stayed, especially because they
said they don't allow camping anywhere else. Sure, if you find me.

First thing was first, the Skyline trail. I conquered that in record time
with no issues. The only wildlife I saw were fresh moose droppings and
a rabbit. I did run into people from Florida and the guy I was waiting at
the center with, but that's it.

The next stop was Macintosh Brook which is a short walk along a creek up
to a fairly decent waterfall. A waterfall that tempted me to get into the
freezing water, just to wash off last nights whatever-you-want-to-call it
and be fresh for the next big hike down the road. I decided against it as
it was too cold and I wasn't sure if it was frownded upon. Maybe I should
just go ahead a break the rules a few times on the Canada portion of the
trip though, right? After the waterfall I went through a 10 minute walk of
a sugar maple tree area that also had a replica Sottish crofter hut. It
was meh.

Last on the list was trail called Aspy, named after the river it runs
adjacent to. I started by going up to see the waterfall and headed back to
the real trailhead and started up. Along the way I managed to pass two
groups of people who were walking in the same direction and one group that
was sitting on the red chair near the top. The trail is a bit strange
because it ends rather abruptly with no signage to tell you whether you've
made it or not. I decided I wanted to get higher to see more things so I
went right and up. The German couple I passed followed and caught up with
me where I stopped and I let them know I didn't know what I was doing but
I was going to continue. As I continued I got to finally see my first good
look at a moose. Check it out!

It ran away as expected and I figured that was a good enough sign to turn
around and head back down. I said goodbye to the Germans and off I went. I
rested for an apple at the base and got on the road, off to find a place to
stay for the night. I drove to three different areas before finding the
beach where I'm writing this post from. Well, I'm in the beach parking right
now but the beach below is sweet. There are even fire pits if I care to
try my hand. Though I have no lighter or flint so that probably won't happen.
Anyway, I'm excited to see the sunrise from the beach tomorrow morning.
Hopefully I can wake up on time and get a nice picture. Sunrises are always
good for pictures.

Refreshing Travel - May 22
---
I woke up to the sound of waves...and went back to sleep because I had left
my phone up in the car and was unsure of the hour of the day. When I woke
up to the waves the second time I felt a little more confident that it wasn't
earlier than 6am. So, I packed up camp and went back up to the car. I had
a breakast of leftover chips and salsa, a piece of fruit, and a granola bar.
Good stuff. The first stop was Green Cove, which was cool but didn't include
a hike so I walked out there and took some photos. As seen here:

![Green Cove 00](/img/green-cove-00.jpg)

![Green Cove 01](/img/green-cove-01.jpg)

Then I went up to Warren Lake, but, on the dirt road on the way to the lake
I saw a hike. That's the great part of driving yourself around, you can
make impulsive stops wherever and whenever you want. So I did. The hike was
OK and the view was pretty average but I enjoyed it all the same. The best
part was that, at the top, my camera started taking black photos for no
reason. I had accidentally left the camera in manual mode for some reason so
I switched it back to my regular aperature mode and as soon as I did that
it started messing up. I haven't been able to fix it. Total bummer. One thing
that is kind of a neat forced experiment is that the video on the camera
still works without a hitch so now I'm going to try and take short videos
instead of photos. The plus side is that you might get some commentary and
if I want to, I can just take some freeze frames of the video as pictures.
They won't be quality photos but they'll be better than taking photos on
my flip phone. That's for sure.

I arrived at the lake and since no one was around I decided to go for a
quick dip to wash myself off. It was so cold. That's all. So cold. I hung
around to do a little reading and left. I got to the other entrance of the
park and went up the Freshwater Lake Lookoff point, took my video and then
got on the road. I stopped off at a Walmart in Sydney in order to pick up
some better supplies for my car curtains. I tried with velcro but the Krazy
Glue and velcro didn't work. I then decided to glue the clips I bought to
the inside of my car. Success! Then I left for Charlottetown, PEI.

It took a good amount of time to get to PEI but I eventually made it to
the Charlottetown Walmart and put up my curtains to get some sleep in their
parking lot. The curtains don't work as well as I had hoped but they did
the trick, only falling off their clips six or so times during setup and
the night itself. Whatever, should do for the trip. I don't want to spend
more money on on these curtains.

Decisoins, Decisions - May 23
---
I got out of car at 8:30am, bought some food from Walmart, had breakfast and
now I'm sitting in Starbucks figuring out where to go from here. I think I
want to circumnavigate the island like Bob told me to. Then I can sleep in
the Walmart parking lot one more time and head to Shediac, New Brunswick.
The only thing I have to start thinking about is timing. I have to be back
in Vancouver before Pemberton music festival because I'm volunterring in it
so I figure I should be in Calgary by July 1st, give or take. That means I've
got 37 days to get my ass across the country. Though I could just panic
drive through almost everything if I run out of time, I think I'll do a
little planning.

Skip forward from Starbucks. I've almost circumnavigated the entire island
which is something Bob suggested. Although I didn't stopp at every
suggested spot, I did choose a few that looked interesting and, to my
surprise, some of them actually were interesting. Highlights include a lot
of gas stations, definitely didn't budget for this portion of my trip, oops,
a beach I found that was completely desolate for about fifteen minutes
before a group of three girls and a dog ruined it, and also the red sand
beaches at Cavendish.

Quick note on the desolate beach. I took a bit of a walk down that beach
and sat down and realized a few things. One, this is the most alone I
think I've ever been in my life, just me and the car and a poorly sketched
out plan on Google Drive. It's not necessarily a bad thing but I am
looking forward to my first friend sighting which should be Doug in Ottawa. 
Two, I've been away for a long time. I took a moment to think about how
I've changed, if at all, and it think I'm pretty much OK with any changes
that have taken place in the last four and a half months or so. I think I've
become more outgoing, more sure of myself, more confident, in my case those
count for two, and also I think I've stopped worrying as much as I used to
about things. Three, I still don't know what I want to do with my life and
that's OK. I've come to accept and laugh at what I thought I would be doing
with myself at this age. Especially the age part of the equation. I used
to think about my age and my timeline a lot. When to get a career, when or
where I would want to move to, girlfriends, a wife, kids, house, the whole
lot. But now I'm kind just content and happy with where I am. I've been
travelling for four and a half months, how is that not as cool as a house?

Anyway, that was a bit of a unloading because I've lying in the car, watching
the last few minutes of the sunset at the north-western tip of PEI feeling
philosophical. Don't expect too much more of this stuff. Good night.

Shediac - May 24
---
I woke up, early as usual because the air in th ecar was cold enough and
then sun was out, though it was foggy. I didn't bother rearranging the car
after my sleep in because I had properly set it up so that the driver side
chair was not affected. I then drove my way into Summerside, found myself
a community pool and splurged the $7.50 to gain access to the pool, hot tub,
and showers. What a treat, a proper shower from the last four or so days.
I stayed in the community pool cafe area for hours after that, catching up
on Facebook stuff, calling my dad for his birthday, and organizing my next
living place. Turns out my friend Tyler has a cousin in Shediac so that was
arranged quite quickly.

After my brain started melting a little, I headed out to Shediac. The drive
was pretty short and I met Alana, Daniel, and their 15 month old son
Sebastien. They're cool people but I had caught Alana in the middle of a
acupuncture session so I left to go check out a beach that Daniel had told
me about. I went WAY too far past the beach and ended up at another that
I managed to find. It was OK. I then made a few wrong turns and had to go
back to said beach in order to find my way back to Shediac Cape where they
live. On the way back I managed to find the original beach. It was much nicer
and included quite a surprising amount of people as well.

I got back to Alana and Daniel's house and chatted with Daniel over some
work he was doing to his car. We spent a good portion of the night chatting.
They seem like great parents and all around decent people for sure. I'm
happy to be able to stay on their lawn, avoiding a crying baby in the night
but also being able to use their laundry appliances and their shower.

High Tides and Tidal Bores - May 25
---
I woke a little after the sun today because I felt a little bit more tired
than usual. Solution, sleep more. It's a simple life I live right now. I
spent the mornig with the my hosts and then headed out to Hopewell Rocks to
check out the rock formation and such during low tide. It was pretty cool
but I'm still quite a bit frustrated that my DSLR has decided to stop taking
photos for me. I then realized that I have a flip phone with a camera on it
and that gave birth to this masterpiece video a little later in the day
during high tide.

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dIxBHPK_zac" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Afterwards, I had myself some food and went into Moncton to check out the
Tidal Bore which is a small wave that passes through the river, caused by
the huge tide change that occurs. It is the biggest tidal difference in the
world so it is not surprising that something like this would happen. As I
parked, however, the weather took a huge turn. All of a sudden there was
a torrential downpour including thunder and lightning. I found a small bit of
shelter where I met a man who looked like he dressed for a warm walk around
town in a sleevless shirt and shorts. Tough luck. We chatted about, you
guessed it, the weather. Weather here, weather in Victoria, weather in
Mexico. All kinds of weather. Eventually the wave showed up. It was not
impressive but it was kind of a cool thing to see regardless. The wave passed
and so I decided to start my way back to Hopewell Rocks to wait for the
high tide.

After about five minutes in the car and a merge onto the main road up to
Hopewell, I realized I was uncomfortable with the amount of water and the
driving conditions so I pulled over and read my Harry Potter book. After a
reasonable amount of time I got back on the road, still dealing with a lot
of standing water but managed to get into a dry patch. I arrived at Hopewell
again and everything that I was walking on ie the ocean floor, was now
submerged in merky water. Pretty neat. I walked around and then went back
to my car. I then went back to the house to hang out. We went and got some
brown food and I spent the night chatting with Alana and Daniel about pretty
much everything. Alana is willing to talk about a lot of topics and it's
great. I thoroughly enjoyed the chats we had about life and he take on
everything as a new parent and an explorer of Asia culture. Back to the tent
for bed, but not before enduring some more amazing amounts of rain, thunder,
and lightning. Crazy night weather-wise.

Reading the Dunes - May 26
---
Since I had not found a host in Quebec City through couchsurfing.com at this
point, I spent a good portion of my time this morning finding trying to
find one. I eventually found a guy that would take me and has free parking
infront of his house. Nice! Then Daniel and Alana shared that the Bouctouche
Dunes were a nice site so I planned to go see them during my day. I headed
out after breakfast and found the dunes with no issue.

It was cold and windy today and after walking about one kilometer out onto
that dunes, I decided I would head back and figure something else out. Alana
had said that there were some great seafood restaurants I could try if
need be. What I decided to do, however, was a bit more solemn. Instead of
going to a social place and eating some good food, I resolved to finish
The Chamber of Secrets in my car, alone, eating peanut putter and jam
sandwiches, chips and salsa, and carrots and celery. So shall it be written
so shall it be done. I finished the book and another podcast from Tim Ferriss
around 7pm and decided it was time to head back. I spent the night with
Alana as Daniel put together his new barbecue talking about all manner of
things. She's a great conversatoinalist. We even managed to tackle all of
the days dishes as we chatted, making it seem like no time had passed.

I decided to pack up the tent after Daniel had offered their couch for the
night. I didn't want to pack up a wet tent in the morning in case it rained
during the night so I took them up on their offer. I packed up the tent and
moved my sleeping bag onto the couch. 'Twas a good day.
