Taking More Than Your Time - July 04
---
The day was spent puttering around, helping where I could, hanging out with
the cousins, and generally relaxing. I'm quite behind on my posts at this
point and so I'll just leave it there for that day.

At night, however, we went to the pool for my cousins' swimming lessons
which was a ton of fun. We did some swimming, some floating, some flipping,
some sliding, some swinging, and some diving. Afterwards, we went to the
famous Tickleberry's ice cream parlour near the house. We each got five
scoops of deliciousness and watched a movie back at the house. Somehow, we
managed to get all of the frozen treat down and didn't have nightmares. Good
work everyone.

Should I Stay or Should I Go? - July 05

Six months! Today marks six months away from home. What a crazy amount of
time to be travelling, at least for me. It's hard to believe that the trip
is coming to its end even though I almost feel right at home again. It's as
if the last six months were just a short video I recently watched. A
highlight reel of my experiences, the people I met, the places I visited, and
the things I did. I feel like it didn't happen. It's a surreal feeling, but
I'm getting used to it.

Today I spent my time as I did the day before with a little more question
about whether or not I would drive in to Vancouver or not. Eventually, I
decided to stay another night because I didn't have my stuff together properly
in time. It got a little late and I just said "Meh, I'll go tomorrow." The
glory of having zero schedule.

Back to Square One - July 06
---
After getting my things together for my anticipated leave, I went down to the
lake with Denzer to get myself in some water. I also got to visit Zoe, as
she was volunteering at this summer thing down by the park near the lake.
I waded in the water a little, dried off in the sun and generally relaxed
as the cousins made crafts and messed around.

I waited at the house until Zoe had finished her volunteering and then I
shoved everything into the car, gave everyone a big hug, and got on my way
back to where I started this journey. The drive was super easy, it is
almost nothing compared to the craziness I got myself through during the
big insurance and registration scare of Ontario.

The first piece of business that I had to take care of was sushi. I had
missed the sushi lunch that me and my friends Jacob and Kazu used to go to
every Wednesday for lunch. But, apparently they still do it. Anyway, I went
to Sushi Garden and ordered my favourite sushi meal, spicy salmon don. Then
I stopped off at the liquor store for some beer. You shouldn't show up
empty handed after all. Then I parked the car outside of my old house and
snuck in. What followed was the most awesome way to be welcomed back after
a long trip. Tyler was there and had organized a little get-together of people
he and I know. It was amazing seeing everyone. Tyler and I had been doing
basically everything together before I left and seeing him again was so
cool. Sorry for making you find a Jeff replacement, Tyler, I'll try not to
do that again.

We spent the night talking, singing, dancing, drinking, laughing, and
partying until the wee hours of the morning. It was a great homecoming.

Signing Off, Sort Of

I think it's here I will end my blog posts. Yes, you heard it. You no longer
have to feel obliged to read these things I keep putting out for no good
reason other than to catalogue my day-to-day dealings. No longer do you have
to suffer through incoherent sentences, spelling mistakes, grammar mishaps,
and generally boring content. You are free to live as you lived before this
blog. Go now, do what you were born to do: surf the internet for another
waste of time.

One more thing: I will put out one or two more posts that aren't related to
my days but more so related to what I learned on the trip, how I feel I've
changed, and any other things that I feel I want to share that have occurred
in the last six months of my life. I might even touch on what I'll be doing
with myself in the coming months and what my plan is for the near future.

See ya!
