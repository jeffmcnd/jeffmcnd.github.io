Northern Cabos, La Paz - Feb 13
---
Having not been able to eat much the day before, I went to get some food a bit
before check out. I didn't eat much but at least it was something. I packed up
and headed out, saying goodbye to the owner as I left. At the time I don't
think I realized that I was still sick so I went on as if nothing was amiss.
Little did I know that the hangover was still lingering. I had to stop several
times because of the heat and my own exhaustion. Once I arrived at the bus
station I felt pretty bad but hopped on the bus all the same. It took about 35
minutes, including one rough two minute period where I thought I would be sick,
before I was finally able to relax and sleep a little.

The bus took about three hours and then we arrived in La Paz just as the sun
was setting. I took a little bit of time to shake off the bus ride buzz and
took a taxi to the hostel, which is a little difficult to find because it's
basically a house where people let you stay. I met a Frenchman named Roman, or
something like that, and he invited me out but I had just eaten two pieces of
nutella on toast and was out for the night.

What to Do, Spend Money of Course - Feb 14
---
After my Nutella induced coma of 14 hours a woke up to an email saying my
flight payment had not been accepted, sweet. I began searching around for
other flights only to find that first class was the only ticket type I could
purchase. I opted to call the airline before hand and they kindly told me my
card was declined, for no reason I might add, and that I needed new tickets.
If you ever want to know how to double your ticket price just let me know, it
is super easy and only the slightest amount annoying and frustrating.

I then called to book a spot on a tour for *Isla Espiritu Santo* which I was
almost able to do in Spanish but, alas, Spanish without gestures from someone's
face or hands is still difficult for me. It was looking like I was going to
be late for the meetup for the boat trip but luckily the owners of the hostel
were headed to town and gave me a ride, nice.

First stop on the trip was a look/swim with some whale sharks. The one we
found was not big, a little less than 3 meters but still pretty cool to see.
I opted to not pay extra for the snorkel and fins but jumped in the water and
took a look as best I could. Next up was a quick stop at a beach to pick up
wet suits where I spoke with some of the other people, regretably, in English.
We then headed to see some sea lions, which was cool but I decided to stay on
the boat this time around mostly because of the cost of a wet suit and the lack
of shade in the water, I had forgotten to bring my sunscreen. The last real
stop was another beach for lunch where we had sandwiches and ceviche and then
relaxed for a good while.

On the way back we stopped at a few cool rock formations and things where the
captain explained a lot of things in Spanish and I'll admit that sometimes I
tune out and just look at stuff. Once back in town, I went for a nice lenghty
jaunt around town, ate some wings that I did not like and went back to the
hostel once again. It was a simple day after the wings fiasco and I believed
I was satisfied with the amount of stuff I saw.

Starting to Enjoy Reading and Waiting - Feb 15
---
Flight day! Today I got up at a leisurely hour, slowly packed my things and
headed for the airport. I asked for directions for the nearest taxi at an Oxxo
and a kind man told me about the clinic where they pick up. I thanked him and
headed out but before I could make it a block, the same man pulled up in his
car and offerred me a ride free of charge because the taxis were too expensive.
What a nice dude. He told me about paying it forward and how I am lucky to be
able to do what I'm doing and he's totally right, sometimes I need to be
reminded that, even though some things don't go that well for me I'm still
incredibly fortunate to be able to do what I'm doing. That was a great mental
boost for me.

I arrived at the airport a little bit earlier than the recommended three hours
before my flight and decided to spend it reading. This is how I read basically
all of Brave New World in one sitting. Thanks for the recommendation, Dan. I
haven't been much of a reader in the past but I've got to say that I'm starting
to enjoy my time reading and relaxing more and more. I don't know if that is
just an age thing or if I'm just that idiot that hasn't read enough in his life
but either way at least I'm enjoying it.

First flight, first class, overpriced, slimy yet satisfying. It was a strange
experience to get the looks from people that said "You do not look like a first
class kind of guy." as I parked my butt in the seat prior to throwing my beat
up backpack in the overhead and sporting my hodge-podge of a tank-top,
pull-over, hat, shorts, and running shoes. It felt kind of good though, maybe
they thought I was some sort of young millionaire or something. Who knows. The
flight went by smooth enough and we landed in the Mexico City Airport. At this
airport I quickly found my gate and sat down. Along comes an elderly woman who
has previously left her things on a chair. She sits down, lies down, and about
two minutes pass before she falls asleep. Not seven minutes later I am given
the privelege of hearing the loudest, most ear-piercing fart I've ever heard
in public come from this lady. She jolted herself awake, quicly sat up and I
proceeded to leave my seat to go laugh. I can't say it makes my ticket price
increase worth it, but it definitely helped.

One hour of a movie later and I landed in Puerto Vallarta, payed way too much
for a taxi and met the kind girl who stayed late at the hostel to check me in
a little after midnight. Alls well that ends well.

A Beach for Everything - Feb 16
---
I woke up, ate some cereal and managed to have a short Spanish conversation
with the new woman behind the hostel counter about how to get to a few of the
places I wanted to visit. I then basically spent the day exploring the city. I
walked south down the beaches, sat, read, and watched the people. I did that
again while coming up the beach too. Then again a little further up. I checked
out the *malec√≥n* and found the restaurant that I was recommended.

After the food and a shower I walked upstairs to see who was hanging out.
Luckily for me it was basically everyone. I introduced myself, grabbed a beer
and our night began. We chatted for a while, we being the Frenchies, three
Danes, an American, and the Dutchman, and eventually the Polish girl that works
at the hostel. A few of us grabbed dinner and then hung out at the hostel
again. It take much time for them to get it out of me that I sing and play
guitar. So, I immediately started playing the songs in my repertoire until my
audience eventually yelled out requests that I was happy to oblige using my
phone when necessary, which was almost every song. This continued until 4am.
At some point during the night we made plans to go to Sayultia and split up to
go to sleep.

<!--
Here we have Los Arcos. I didn't know what to expect when I heard about them
and I have to say that I'm quite underwhelmed.

A Surf Town and A Whole Chicken - Feb 17
---
Like clockwork, everyone that had agreed was awake and ready to depart to
Sayulita. The group was made up of Barbara (the Polish hostel worker), Jesse
(the American), and myself (god knows what I am to them). We met up with
Barbara's friend Sofia at the Walmart stop, wished her a happy birthday and
got on the next bus for the surf town of Sayulita.

Upon arrival we split to get food, Jesse and I went to a small chicken cart.
Seeming like he knew what he was doing quickly ordered "Dos pollos, por favor."
After seeing how much chicken they put on the grill to heat up, I immediately
understood that they took his order to mean two whole chickens where Jesse was
expecting two tacos. I'm confident that my Spanish would allow a fix to this
problem, but instead I let it happen, taking a chicken for myself and splitting
the bill. We ate what we could, walked around the town, and head to the beach
where we met up with the girls again. And so began a whole lot of chilling at
the beach. I didn't spend much time reading, instead opting to grab some of the
extra sleep I felt entitled too after being made to sing for five hours
straight.

At some point Jesse decided to explore the town more and that was the last we
saw of him for the night. As the sun set we ended up meeting with Edwin and
another hostel-goer named Efren from the night before. We grabbed a few beers
and chatted on the beach until it was time for our bus. One sleepy but bumpy
ride later and we made it to sweet bedlike salvation.

Here's a photo of the sunset in Sayulita.

Lapping Around Yelapa - Feb 18
---
Having made some plans with the group last night to visit Punta Negra I was
up on time for our 9am departure. The problem was that Efren was the only other
person who was also ready. Jesse was up and about while I was reading in the
lounge area and I was sick of waiting for people so we both decided to check
out my originally desired location of Yelapa, a recommendation from Gonzo.

We took a bus to Boca-something-or-other (too lazy to type into Google) and
were greated by a man who spoke English well. While selling us the tickets for
the water taxi he told us that they were 140 pesos each, for a total of 280. I
heard him say some different number so I attempted to repeat him saying "240,
right?" and he looked a bit confused and started to write down my number. I had
no intention of changing the price because it was already pretty reasonable but
I didn't know that this sort of thing would've even worked. One water taxi
later and we were in Yelapa. We quickly walked up to see the waterfall which
acted as a nice fresh water shower and massage and headed to the beach for some
food, beer, and relaxation.

Here's a photo of a cat I found while waiting for the water taxi, no context
included! The internet loves cats and I'm just trying to get famous.

Jesse tried his first ceviche, and loved it. I'm so glad I could introduce
someone else to this dish, so damn tasty. If you haven't, try it.
Almost too soon and it was time to head back on the boat. But before we did
that, the same man from before was adding up our bill for the restaurant. He
gave us the total of 420 pesos, to which I jokingly replied "Don't you mean
380?" We laughed and he took Jesse's 500 peso bill. After Jesse got his cash we
quietly realized that he gave us 120 pesos in change. I then came to the
conclusion that I have some secret power of influence. It is a power I will
weild with the utmost brazen disregard. Yeah, disregard is the right word.

Another water taxi and bus and we were back at the hostel, saying goodbye to
one of the French people from the other night who, unfortunately, did not get
to see the whales she was wanted to see for the past two days. I quickly parked
myself here in the lounge area and began writing this blog post. Now I'm
thinking about what to write next as I write this sentence.

Wait.

I can see that I've caught up to myself on the blog. Nice!

At this point I'm figuring out buses and accommodation for Guadalajara and
pensively thinking about what I actually want to accomplish with the rest of
my travels. At first, I decided to travel mainly because I had some friends
who recommended Mexico and I had a blast trying to learn Spanish so I wanted an
outlet to try it out and become truly fluent. As I go, I'm realizing that I'm
kind of just following a path that I think anyone might take through this
country instead of putting more thought into where I want to go, what I want to
see, and how I want to do it. I know I want to make more friends, I know I want
to become more fluent in Spanish, but I'm not sure where I want to do that.

If you've got suggestions for anything I'd love to hear them. Thanks for
reading, everyone!
