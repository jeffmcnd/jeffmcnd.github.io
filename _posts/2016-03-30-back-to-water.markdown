Quick Stop In Cholula and Kayaks - Mar 24
---
This morning I spent a lot of time finding some good resources to warm myself
up in the morning for Spanish speaking. I've found, though I'm not proud to
admit it, that I'm a little slow on the draw when I try to speak or listen
in the mornings. So I found Radio Cinco and Telemundo News to work pretty
well. I then went to Cholula to tourist around there for a while. I sat in the
park for a bit to people watch and then I climbed the hill/pyramid to the main
church to people watch. I then got a text from Antonio asking if I wanted to
go kayaking. Uh, yes please.

It took about one hour to get to his little slice of the lake and we had headed
out on the lake in a kayak each with his mom's dog Diana. This was incredibly
relaxing and we had a ton of laughs. It was a great time. On the paddle back
into his spot on the lake we decided to switch to English. Antonio told me
my voice in Spanish is harder than in English which is funny because the
Spanish girl Eva told me the opposite. Who knows. What I do want to note is
my new outlook on foreign accents.

Basically, I strived to have as little of an accent as possible because I
think it's both more impressive to native speakers and, of course, they can
understand you more easily. Both good things, however, I realized that, as a
perfectionist, I was upset every time someone told me that they heard my
Canadian accent come through when I talked. The most recent time this happened
was with Carla in Teotihuacan after we had been speaking English for a full
day. I was a little down in the dumps after that. But now, thinking about all
of it, as long as I can express myself as intelligently as I want, I don't
think it matters nearly as much as I thought. In my experience, I used to put
a small judgement on those who don't speak English as a first language,
thinking that they hadn't put enough effort into learning to speak properly.
But it's hard to get right and hard to hear the differences. I haven't had
the prejudice for a while and I'm realizing that I don't need to put that same
prejudice on myself. I feel much better now.

After the lake we dropped off Antonio's car and dog and headed to a restaurant
for some dinner. We ate pizza, potato appetizers, dessert, and headed out for
a some time on the town. We started off at a bar that Antonio recommended.
However, the place was pretty empty so we had one beer and left. We then went
to Container City, downed one shot of mezcal like water and then we walked
the strip to find a club. We were attracted into a bar by a girl telling us
that there was a promotion of 10 shots for 100 pesos. Deal. But a bad one. I
think I need to start realizing that just because I'm in a new town with a
new friend doesn't mean that I have to drink my face off with that new friend.
Let's just say the shots didn't sit well, but they didn't sit for long anyway.
We grabbed some tacos al pastor across the street and I spent the rest of the
night being a party pooper. Too bad you had to deal with that, Antonio. Maybe
the next time I visit things will be a little smoother.

Oaxaca Aqui, Otra Vez - Mar 25
---
In the morning I rose out of my bed, a little reluctantly, and got myself and
my things together to leave. I spent some time doing nothing before asking
about where to catch the bus for the bus station. By that time, however, the
parade had started. Of course, it's almost Easter and I'm in Mexico, a country
where every city has seven back up churches despite the size of the city. It
was around this time that I decided to check up on my finances, something I
hadn't done for almost a month. Big news coming from my bank, someone got
a hold of my debit card that I lost somewhere and started taking money out of
my account about six days ago. I had already started the process of cancelling
my card but they didn't actually do the cancellation, cool. I spent some time
first figuring out why the microphone on my phone wasn't working and then
called the bank to sort it out. They said it would take around ten business
days. Classic bank move. Nothing I can do about it now though, whatever.

The parade lasted for a while and then I got some lunch. After lunch I got
myself to the bus station and hopped on my bus to Oaxaca. The bus ride was
pleasant. I listened to Juanes, read HP, listened to a few Spanish podcasts,
and rested. I still remembered where my last hostel was from last time and I
was lucky enough that they had a spare bed without having a reservation.
Score.

I settled in and walked the main square for a while. This time around it is
busy and full of pop-up shops, restaurants, games, rides, and the like. I
got some tacos al pastor and watched the final minutes of the Canada vs Mexico
game which ended up with a win to Mexico at 3-0. That's fine, I already knew
Canada can't play soccer. For starters we called it soccer. Enough said. Back
at the hostel I hand-washed some clothes, asked about Hirve el Agua, and
basically went to sleep. Today was simple and full of reflection and
nothingness.

Hierve el Agua and Back to the Night Bus - Mar 26
---
Keep it simple. I went to Hierve el Agua today. Half way, I met some Mexicans
that shared a taxi with me. We chilled, it was relaxing and cool. We did a
small amount of hiking to get better photos. We hitch hiked back almost all
the way to Oaxaca City then shared another cab. I ended my night with tacos
and a crepe waiting for my night bus to Puerto Escondido.

Here are some photos:

New Beach, Same Story, a Summary - Mar 27 - Mar 31
---
The night bus went pretty well but I didn't sleep much. I got to the hostel
after a short walk from the bus station. I spent a few hours checking out the
first beach that is closest to the hostel, not impressed, and hanging out
with a mixture of people from America, Australia, Germany, Mexico, and England.
This seems like a pretty chill spot but it just reminds me of Sayulita. With
that in mind I decided that I'm going to cull one night's stay in Puerto
Escondido, skip Mazunte, shorten my stay in San Cristobal de las Casas and
spend more time in Sayulita. I'm thinking I might have to visit Mexico City
again because I didn't spend enough time hanging out with all my friends there.

For the rest of the days in Puerto Escondido we spent our time either chilling
in the hostel, eating at the nearby restaurants, or at the beach. Obviously.
I didn't bother keeping up with the blog posts here because I knew it would
be similar to those posts from Sayulita where we just had fun and relaxed.
Although there isn't a lot going on, it's nice.
