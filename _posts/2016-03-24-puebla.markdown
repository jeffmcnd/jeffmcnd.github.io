Walking Around Minding Our Own Business - Mar 20
---
First things first, breakfast! Abi, Citlali (Abi's sister), and Chicken (the
nickname of Citlatli's boyfriend, Zachary) and I went to a restaurant called
OaxacAqui. I can't remember what the dish was called but it was good. I want
to say Enfrijoladas but I can't be sure. Go there, try them. They came with
*cafe de olla* which is a sort of super sweet coffee with cinnamon which
wasn't half bad. Would recommend.

Afterwards, Abi and I walked around and ended up at *Biblioteca Vasconcelos.*
I like this place a lot and could see myself reading and/or studying there
no problem. Everything in the place feels like its floating and, on the day,
there were a ton of people outside near the building rehearsing for what I can
only assume to be some sort of dance group/boy band competition. I wish I had
taken a video for proof but oh well. We grabbed some ice cream and chilled
in the plaza near Abi's house for a little while too.

We also walked around the mall near the library for a second to try and find
me some washable insoles but failed. I then did my laundry at Chicken's
apartment and we headed back to Abi's apartment when it was done to hang my
clothes up to dry. I little bit of chill time, enough to introduce them to
Allen Stone and Vulfpeck, my go to music of choice for people who ask me to
put on music, and Abi and I headed to this Euro Jazz festival. The music that
was one was pretty catchy and I want to say the group was from Germany but we
didn't stay long enough to figure out who they were. We then went to Coyoacan
and got some food at *La Cerveceria De Barrio.* for dinner. Tasty.

We then made the long journey back to Abi's place and spent the night
relaxing, listening to music, and chatting. We got on to a few topics that I
didn't think I would get to talk about in Spanish. Stuff like Canada's
electoral system and how it might change as well as how to play Stack Cup.
Good practice is good.

Floating Around - Mar 21
---
I'm not in the mood to write much a blog post today. However, here's what I
did.

- We had breakfast at OaxacAqui again, it was just as good as the last time
- We figured out and executed our plan to meet with Abi's friends
- We headed out to Xochimilco to go for a float with Abi's friend's family
  from Costa Rica
- I drank quite a bit of booze on the three hour trip
- Abi and I went for pizza
- We ended up in a bar with a live show of classic Mexican tunes and roping

Here are some photos and videos.

A Puebla Named Pueblo, Or Is It The Other Way Around? - Mar 22
---
After getting some food at the super market with Abi, I introduced her to my
oats meal. She liked it but thought it was a bit too heavy for her. Fair
enough, it is more for going on long runs and skipping lunches than for a
regular light breakfast. For the most part we just hung out trading off new
music and doing nothing on our laptops. I was looking up some things that
eventually were cast aside because I wouldn't use them.

After I made my arrangements (none) I had my stuff fully packed, lacking my
sunglasses, hugged Abi, and left. Travelling around seems easier now that I've
acquired my "Mexican Confidence" as I and some other people I've met have
put it. I tend to not be nearly as worried about asking for things as I was
when I arrived in Mexico because I don't mind making mistakes in my speech as
much and I am also becoming proficient at asking the same questions over and
over. I got on the subway and headed to the TAPO bus station. Simple. Got
my ticket. Simple. Took a bus. Simple. Managed to sleep. Hell yes. Got off bus
onto another bus. Nicely done. Got off bus after realizing I had missed my
stop by a few blocks. Damn, you were looking so good.

After settling into the hostel I decided to head to the Zocalo which is when
Beth's friend Antonio started messaging me and said he would pick me up.
Speaking about confidence, I haven't tried to speak Spanish over the phone
since I failed hard in La Paz, maybe I should give it a shot again soon.
Antonio took me to Cholula which is about 30 minutes away by car to see the
town at night. We had some dinner at a nice place called Cus Cus and headed
to Container City. This is exactly what you think it is. There are a bunch of
shipping containers that have been converted into bars and restaurants. After
impressing Antonio and three or four people he knew at the bar with my ability
to down a couple shots of mezcal without wincing we walked for a time.
We realized everything was closed so we went back to my hostel. Antonio is a
cool dude, very smooth, very nice (paid for my food and mezcals), and funny.
He said we'd see each other again for for some drinks on Thursday night in
Cholula. Party!

Walking Around The Pueblita - Mar 23
---
This morning I spent my time creating a map of the suggestions that Antonio
gave me yesterday and chatting with a Spanish girl that left after breakfast.
After that I made moves. Here's a list of places I visited during the day:

- Capilla de Rosario
- Terraza Barroca
- Plazuela de los Sapos
- Mercado el Parian
- Museo casa del Alfenique
- Paseo de San Francisco
- Museo de Arte Religioso Ex Convento Santa Monica
- El Mirador
- Fuerte Loreto
- Teleferico Puebla (Though I didn't ride it, lines were too long)

Some notes: some of these places I didn't actually go into and also this is
probably the most classically touristy day I've had so far.

Here are some photos:

Some kids playing with bubbles.

I'm not sure why I have this picture.

Did I do that right?

And that about sums it up. After walking around the hill and mirador for a
while I sat down and read HP for a bit, didn't get far though, and started
back to town. I grabbed some delicious tacos al pastor at Don Pastor and spent
the rest of my night in the hostel just relaxing. I started learning Volverte
A Ver by Juanes and that's going well. Cholula is next and I'm supposed to
have quite the night with Antonio as well. Let's hope I can get through it
and be able to travel to Oaxaca or wherever I'm going next tomorrow.
