Amigos Nuevos, Rosca de Reyes, Busear, La Playa, Mas Amigos, y Tequila

What a great few days I've had in Mexico so far. From where we left off last,
I was in Cancun. So in the morning I made my way to the ADO bus station where
I would be taking the bus to Playa (Playa del Carmen) and then crossing over
on the ferry to Cozumel to meet Eva's friends Raul and Alejandro.

At the bus station I found a Telcel store where I hoped to buy a SIM card
(Amigo Chip). First thing I ask is "Hablas ingles?" which usually receives the
answer "No." This was the case with the guy working the store. No worries, I
know enough Spanish to do this. I managed to succeed after we fashioned a tool
to open the SIM card slot and I was elated that I managed to buy something I
needed speaking only in Spanish!

I grabbed some lunch and hopped on the bus to Playa, waited for the 1pm and met
Alex on the other side in Cozumel. We went to his aparment where I met Raul
just before he left for work. It's worth noting that all these new friends are
doctoral students doing their practicums, or at least I suppose that is what
you would call it. They're originally from Merida. Alex and I did a quick drive
around the island and he taught me about the island, how the street
numbers/names work and was patient with my Spanish, though he speaks English
perfectly. He then taught me about Rosca de Reyes (King's Ring), where the 
word king refers to the three wise men and the word ring refers to the shape
of the thing, not *un anillo*. That's all I'll say about that but here
is a link for the lazy
[Rosca de Reyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosca_de_reyes).

So we went to Raul's work and I met his work mates and we all ate Rosca. I
didn't manage to get a miniature plastic baby Jesus in either of my two pieces
of Rosca but it was a tasty treat. Then we had *sope*, a traditional Mexican
dish which is a lot like what Canadians know as tacos, but the tortilla is more
pastry-like and flat. Again, tasty. [Sope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sope)
. Raul, Alex, and I then went to Eva's boyfriend, Rick's place and met him and
his family and friends. They're nice people and we got along really well. Rick
generously invited me out on his boat to which I calmly accepted, though inside
I felt like a six year-old girl about to go to Disneyland.

We went out with Rick's kids Chris and Julia for a few drinks and had a great
time switching between languages, including Canadian and American.

The next day I went out with Rick and his family and friends and we all went
scuba diving. I think the last time I did that was in high school in an indoor
pool. I got a quick lesson and we went for a 40ft dive. It is another world
down there, man. The reef is beautiful, the fish are beautiful and I had an
amazing time. Unfortunately I don't have a GoPro or a waterproof camera so I
don't have any pictures but I think you can just take my word for it that is
was awe-inspiring.

When I returned to Alex and Raul's apartment, I was met with three new faces.
They're names are Ricki, Alex's brother and Claudio and Chico, Alex's cousins.
Or at least that was my understanding. At first it was a bit awkward, 
linguistically, but they all speak better English than I do Spanish, though I
asked them to speak Spanish anyway. They only speak English when they don't
want to wait for my delayed translation, but not in a mean way at all, which is
fair. There were six of us living in Alex and Raul's apartment. We went to
catch a sunset at the end of the night.

The six of us went out with Rick's kids again to another bar and we had a total
blast and retired to Rick's place for more drinks. I had bought a tequila
liquor which has the same kind of smell as tequila but the taste is much
sweeter than what you would expect. There are pictures of that event on
Facebook if you care to look them up. Good stuff.

The next day, the six of us went to a sandy beach on the other side of the
island. Beaches are pretty, I don't think I need to tell you that. Chico,
Ricki, and I did a bunch of body surfing and tired ourselves out pretty well.
Somehow I managed to only get a small burn on my back, nothing serious which is
good because now I know my *bloqueador* works as advertised.

Before heading out of the apartment we bought some tacos, real Mexican tacos.
They were tasty with *pastor* and hot sauce but I think I still have a larger
than Mexican appetite because they said that the tacos were quite large so I
assumed three would be enough. Not quite the case, but close. We went and had
dinner with Rick and his family and I finally got to meet Eva, the orchestrator
of basically all my fun so far in Mexico. Thanks Eva! She's lovely.

Later on, we went and dinner at an Italian restaurant with **everyone.** This
includes Rick, his family, Eva, and everyone staying at Alex and Raul's place.
Rick generously footed the bill for everyone, he's a generous guy to say the
least. We hung out at Rick's place for quite late and had fun relaxing.

On...Saturday...yeah...Saturday...we went to another beach called *Playa Azul.*
This beach is a bit more touristy and has a few more rocks in it. It was here
I tried *ceviche*, yeah I'd never had it before. Jeff approved. I also tried
a *micheleda* which contained lemon juice, worcester sauce, and a beer. There
may have been more ingredients but I don't remember. They were OK once you got
enough beer in them. We also went to another beach on the south side of the
island I believe. This one wasn't really fit for swimming as the waves were
too large and there were rocks everywhere but we chilled for a while with some
drinks and such.

It was this day I decided to start writing down new words that I'm learning.
Get this, today I added over 120 new words. I clearly didn't learn any
important things during my self-study. After that we grabbed more drinks and
hung out at Alex and Raul's apartment. A little later that night, Julia, Eva,
Angel, and Juan showed up to hang out. It's worth noticing that once Eva and
Julia show up that we mostly speak in English. Again we had a great time
talking about whatever came to mind and eventually played a game where you
write a famous person's name on a card and give it to the person on your right.
Then everyone sticks that card to their forehead and begins asking yes or no
questions about who they've got on their face. I was Einstein, *Gracias, 
Ricki.*

Angel and Juan left before the game and quite early in general and Eva and
Julia left after the game. Once those two left, we switched back to Spanish.
Once we switched back to Spanish, everyone told me that I'm really funny in
English and though I'm sure I'm funny in Spanish I know that two things: it's
note a noteworthy type of funny, and it's probably not for the same reasons as
in English. *No me importa,* as long as I'm funny, I'm happy.

OK, we're caught up. I think that may be considered a long post. I'll try to
keep these things short so no one has to strain too much. Until next time.
