Nova Scotia, Eh? - May 16
---
After the long ferry, I awoke, tried to go back to sleep, realized that my
body hurt too much from sleep on the floor and actually got up. Soon after,
we docked and were unloaded. I was immediately greeted by a man telling me
about his shuttle service to Halifax that was almost $15 cheaper than the
bus that I had planned on taking that would leave one hour later. Since there
were no cars worth seeing in Cape Breton I decided to go for it. Luckily
it wasn't a scam and I arrived in Halifax some hours later at Bob's place.
Bob is a neighbour of mine back when I was living at home. I can't remember
exactly when him and his wife showed up on the street but we've at least
known of eachother for more than probably seven years. It is extremely
lucky for me that he happened to be sent here for work because he was able
to put me up for a few days. I met with his friend Bill at the coffee shop
across from the apartment and dropped my bags off.

Bill was leaving today so he packed and we went off to get some food, Bill
paid. Nice guy. I'm getting quite good at accepting small gifts like this
at this point in the trip. Before I would refuse a few times and probably
try to pay behind the person's back if I could swing it. Now it's more of
a "You don't have to do that." as I take out my wallet, fully intending to
pay but also testing the peron's resolve, and eventually a "Well thanks, I
appreciate that a lot." We then met up with Bob at his work, headed to the
airport, dropped off the second vehicle and then Bob took me for the next
extremely Canadian activity of my trip. Axe throwing. Yeah, you read that
right. Genuine axe throwing with his work mates in a place that both has
axes and a liquor license. How they pull it off I will never know.

Good thing for me at this place is my background in golf, my beard, and the
black toque I brought with me. All of these things helped me with technique,
appearance, and... well actually that's about all there is to it. I managed
I few wins out of the Canadians vs Kiwis tourny they had going on. I even
managed to be part of the top 8 but got knocked out because they wanted
even numbers of Canadians and Kiwis. No biggy. It was a great night out and
I'm incredibly lucky to have a friend here in Halifax to stay with while
I sort out the rest of my trip. Thanks Bob, I definitely owe you one.

Let's Buy a Car - May 17
---
I woke up about two hours after I had told Bob I would wake up. The combo
of floor sleep and beers seemed to call for a few extra zees. After waking
up I made my borrowed classic breakfast of oats and bananas and got on my
computer to find myself a vehicle. I managed to phone probably about 20
different people looking around and I think half of them were already sold.
Way to keep up with that, everyone. A few were too far for me to be able
to see, but a few others were just right so I arranged a couple of meets
for the evening. I also managed to sort out some financial things while I
was at it and do some research on how to insure a car out of province as a
resident of BC in NS. It was a productive few hours. Feels good.

I got a some sushi for lunch to satisfy a craving and hopped into MEC for
a quick look at the pricing for camping gear. I plan on buying a tent,
sleeping mat, and sleeping bag just in case I feel like being outside of
the car on any given night but the price wasn't agreeing with me too
well. Lucky for me there is a 10% deal at MEC if you buy that combination
of items a the same time. I figure I will have to spend about $500 for the
lot so I didn't bother purchasing anything until after I find the car. I
don't want to be too close to broke when I get back home.

After that I got some groceries and spent the rest of the afternoon making
pasta and guacamole which I can't seem to stop making. Mexico lives on
inside me. As the time approached I saw my first vehicle, a Jeep Cherokee
which looks almost exactly like the Jeep that Jacob Gulliver bought a
little while ago and, although I thought it would be funny to get it, I was
not overly impressed with its condition. However, it was a candidate. A
time after that and I managed to get the second vehicle driven to me for a
viewing as well. I must be charming or something. This one was a Saturn
SW1 Wagon. More of the style of car I was looking for. Something with good
MPG, space for sleeping, and a few seats in case I want to take a few
passengers to subsidize my gas costs.

I spent about an hour with the car and the owner, Roger, and decided that
one, it was a great looking car with low KMs for its age, two, the owner seems
like a trustworthy guy who owns a bicycle shop that also sells guitars,
basically the coolest gig and who plays in four bands, and three, I need a
car and I don't want to spend many more days on finding one. Just like that,
I handed over a deposit to get the car taken down from Kijiji and to seal
my promise to purchase this green machine as soon as possible, barring the
insurance fiasco that I can only assume with follow tomorrow. None the less,
I'm incredibly excited for the road trip portion of the journey to start
and I'm stoked to see what this car can help me do. Check in later for some
post deal photos!

Adding a Member to the Trip - May 18
---
After waking up a little earlier than the day before I made my oatmeal with
banana with vigor, excited to finish the car deal. Once I got settled, I
grabbed my phone and called ICBC to get the insurance done. There was only
one snag: there is a four hour time difference between me and BC. Right,
forgot about that. I spent the next two and a half hours watching a John
Mulaney comedy special and wasting time. Even though I could have spent it
doing important/useful things. It seems I've slipped right back into my
old habits of procrastination. I should work on that.

After the wait, the numerous amount of phone calls began between insurance
companies, Nova Scotia DMV, called Access Nova Scotia by the way, and a
few people I had emailed about cars to let them know I had found one. I came
to the conclusion that I needed to venture outside to get everything sorted.
Since I had no luck getting ahold of an actual Access Nova Scotia branch,
I had to take the bus. The bus takes about an hour to get out of downtown
and I sorted out what I needed from the seller in order to get registered.
While at the branch, I purchased my ICBC binder insurance policy and then
got another bus to the business of the owner of the car to grab the title,
keys, and to take care of some paperwork. One more bus later and I was out
at the Access Nova Scotia again. I had no issues and I left with a temporary
license plate and a big smile on my face. One more hour long bus later
and I found myself at a closed TD bank, crap. I called the car owner and he
was conveniently able to re-route me to another TD branch so I could
withdraw my money. One more short bus later and I was at his business, we
closed the deal, shook hands, and my grin grew two sizes that day.

I'm incredibly excited to introduce you all to Ivy, my new-to-me Saturn SW1.
It's dark green, hence the name Ivy, given to it from the previous owner,
the wife of the man selling the car. This car is a dream so far. From what
I can tell, though I'm no expert, it's in great shape, engine sounds fine,
radio works, A/C works (bonus!), steering wheel works, it can move forward
on it's own, and I'm confident it won't fall apart in, I don't know, say
8,000 kilometers. Just enough to get home.

Today was a big win for me. The money for the motorcycle I just sold to my
friend, Trevor, just came in, I bought I car for my travels, and I'm just
such a happy camper. I amped to go out and buy a few things for the trip
and get things started. Canada, get ready for us!

Supply Run and Peggy's Cove - May 19
---
This morning I planned out my day pretty well. I downloaded a bunch of
maps from Google so I wouldn't get lost on my way to Staples to print out
my proof of insurance, Walmart to grab gear for the trip ahead, and Peggy's
Cove for my first sight seeing trip of around Halifax. Everything started
out great. The Staples was close as hell so I printed my stuff and walked
out like a boss. I then saw that Citadel Hill was within walking distance
so I decided to do that too. A few photos, a walk around the canons, some
old timey gun displays, and a trench later and I hopped back in the car to
get my ass to Walmart. I'm going to cut this part of the story short because
it's fairly embarassing. It took me three tries to figure out how to get to
Walmart because I don't have a smartphone right now. Basically, the turn
off for the street I kept missing was less than one metre after the turn
before it, something I didn't get from my PDF saved map on my laptop.

Anyway, I'm in Walmart and I grab a bunch of necessities like cigarette
power adapter for laptop and phone charging, clips with tape for hanging
curtains in the car if I need to sleep in the thing, rubbing alcohol to
clean the areas for the clips, shop towels for messes, a casette adapter
for music/podcast purposes, and three stickers for the letters I, V, and Y.

![Ivy's nametag](/img/ivys-nametag.jpg)
Yeah, I gave her a nametag.

After a quick lunch I then headed out to Peggy's Cove. I stopped off at the
Nova Scotia insuranc place again to learn if the title I have for the car
will do me well for the rest of the trip. Turns out I might have some
trouble when my registration runs out. I will cross that bridge when I get
to it. I arrived at Peggy's Cove a little under an hour later and it's is
definitely a cove. Lighthouse, rocks, water. What more could you ask from
a cove. Nothing. That's what. Job done. I spent some time taking photos
of the cove and tons of inukshuks that some people had made shortly before
sitting down to read a bit of my newest book by Charles Duhigg on how to
be productive because I still procrastinate as an adult, sometimes to a
debilitating level.

Here are some photos of the cove and some inukshuks.

I headed back to the apartment after a chapter and started to research
how I was going... yeah I went on Reddit. That procrastination thing wasn't
a joke. Once Bob got back he sat me down to tell me how I was going to
execute the rest of my trip with this car. This guy has Canada down pat.
He told me all the places I should go, how to get there, what to see, what
to eat, and how to do it all. My list of suggestions became the shadow of
a figure of a real plan tonight. It was cool listening to him and it got
me excited for the rest of my trip. Gonna be dope!
