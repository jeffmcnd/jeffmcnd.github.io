Are You Sure You've Been in Mexico for Three Months? - Apr 06
---
Once I arrived in Campeche I got myself to the hostel with relative ease. I
met a guy named Ryan from California who works from his computer. I asked him
about the sites and the scenes and he basically told me everything I had read
in my Mexico book. No problem. I had bobbled around on my laptop for a
sufficient amount of time before realizing that it was midday and I had done
nothing. I decided to walk the town. I slapped on my hat and no sunscreen and
began the flip flop footed journey. I am describing it that way to help you
realize how many mistakes I made. One, it was midday, that's when the sun
will be at its hottest. Two, I didn't wear sunscreen. Three, I wore flip flops
to go for a walk. Get the picture?

I saw pretty much all of the Centro Historico in an hour or so and decided
to go into the architecture museum. While it was interesting, it was also a
lot of reading and fairly dead inside. After the museum I sent a message to
my friend Raul living in Cozumel who had given me the recommendation to visit
this town to see if he had any specific recommendations. He had none. Oh well,
it seemed to be more of a "good to see it" kind of situation. Which is true,
because the town center still has these ancient walls and "forts" used to
protect itself from pirate attacks. Pretty neat. I walked to the market to
check it out, because you have to do that when you get to a new city. It is
basically the same as all the others and now that I think about it, maybe you
don't have to see the market.

I spent the rest of the day relaxing at the hostel, trying to let what I have
now labeled as sickness pass by. I think this is the effect of the heavy
drinking from the other night. I haven't had a solid sleep since and my
stomach has been ever so slightly uneasy. Though I'm not in any pain or
anguish, I'm more so annoyed with how I'm feeling.

Nothing to See, Nothing to Do, A Lack of Want - Apr 07
---
After a bit of broken sleep I woke up around 9am and set up shop in the hostel
common area with my computer, books, water, and lack of motivation to do
anything at all. And so it was set and so it was done. I spent almost the
entire day in front of the fan in the common area of the hostel on my
computer watching videos, doing Anki, looking up remote jobs, online Android
development courses, random things, places to visit near Merida, and of
course the fan favourite, Facebook. I did, however, leave the hostel to get
ingredients for making some pasta. Then I made the pasta. I even ate it as
well. It was alright.

Just after 8pm I decided to go check out *La Puerta Tierra* to see if the
show was on like my book had described. I arrived late so I sadly had to find
something else to do. That something else turned into a movie with popcorn
and a ginger ale because ginger ale always used to sooth an unruly stomach
when I was little. Why, I don't know. At any rate I finished the movie and
went to bed.

Do you ever wonder if you have a travel limit? An amount of time you can
travel before you start wanting to either do nothing or maybe just go back
to work or at least home? I've been thinking about this a lot lately and
although I don't think I actually want to leave, sometimes it's difficult
to figure that out and be rational. Maybe it's just getting too hot.

Suh, Dude? - Apr 08

Slightly boring start happened with this day. I basically put off doing
anything in order to wait for the temperature to cool down before taking my
bus to Merida. I sat in the hostel, caught up on blog stuff, watched another
movie (I'm getting good at it), and drank water. I think I'm in a bit of a
rut. Who knows.

My bus left the station at 4pm and I arrived in Merida at about 6:30pm. I
walked to the hostel as that is the most economic way of doing things. It was
weird walking through Merida again, not only because I had been before but
also because the power was out in a large portion of the town. After a shower
I went to the zocalo to meet up with Nick, a man I have encountered three
times before on this trip. You know. Nick. We went to a restaurant I had been
to before so I could get some food and after we went to a Mayan Pub, a place
I had been to before to have a beer and meet up with Chico and Claudia, the
siblings that I originally met in Cozumel and then again in Merida the first
time. They're still cool. *Todavia me caen bien.*

Nick's *friend* Argentina also showed up at the bar to hang out. We chatted
all night and eventually ended up at the German bar that I had visited the
last time I was here. I think we'll have to start going to places I have
seen pretty soon or I'll go crazy. The brother and sister duo walked me to my
hostel and we said goodnight, promising to see more of eachother during my
visit. Claudia still says I'm not Mexican. I'm a little disappointed but
she's pretty hard on me anyway so I'm not going to let it bother me. Jaja.

Here's a photo of the pool in the hostel. I think this is my favourite hostel
that I've stayed at.

Que Estoy Haciendo Conmigo? - Apr 09
---
Voy a intentar a escribir un "post" en espanol, sin ayuda del internet o
cualquier otra cosa. Preparate. 

Esta manana me levante a las nueve. Fui a la area comun del hostal para
desayunar y vi mis amigos alemanes de San Cristobal de las Casas. Solo han
llegado de Palenque en un autobus de la noche. Hablamos un poco sobre que
ibamos a hacer en los dias siguientes. Planee mi viajes en Merida y decide que
voy a ir a Progreso, Uxmal, y Izamal hasta el martes. Hay un show de luz en
Uxmal y Izamal y Progreso es una playa. Los alemanes se fueron y envie un
mensaje a Nick para ver si queria hacer algo conmigo. Nick no me envio un
mensaje en respuesta entonces estoy en el hostal escribiendo este "blog post."
No se que voy a hacer hoy. Tal vez ire al mercado para comprar cosas para
cocinar esta noche. No estoy seguro que debo conseguir un lugar de
CouchSurfing porque el precio en este hostal es bueno. Veremos!

Una cosa mas.
Estoy seguro que estoy en un punta baja ahorita. No se porque, tal vez
necesito ver mis amigos en Vancouver y Victoria y mi familia tambien. En este
momento he viajado lo mismo numero de dias en Mexico que viaje en Europa
cuando tenia 18 anos. Pero en este caso, no tengo un amigo con quien estoy
viajando. Es verdad que tengo amigos en Merida, seguro, pero este es
diferente. Siento extrano. Extrano mi familia y mis amigos de Canada. Es un
sentimiento extrano porque tengo esta oportunidad asombrosa y no se que
quiero hacer. Creo que quiero vivir en un lugar por un rato pero no puedo
porque tengo que, pues no TENGO QUE, regresar a muchas lugares otra vez. Y
cuando termine en Mexico, voy a empezar la misma cosa en Canada. La unica
diferencia es que tendre un coche y el idioma sera diferente.

Tiempos asi, cuando me pregunto "Por que estoy viajando?", "Que quiero
hacer con el resto de mi dinero y tiempo?", y "Que quiero hacer cuando
regreso a Vancouver y Victoria? Quiero trabajar como antes? Que quiero?" Y la
verdad es que no se nada. Una amiga mi dijo en Facebook que estas teniendo un
"crisis" de cuarto vida. Creo lo tengo tambien pero me parece que estoy
quejando cuando tengo una vida libre y mas o menos facil. Solo que yo se es
que quiero aprender mas el espanol y empezar aprender mas idiomas cuando he
dominado bastante del espanol. Espero que lo averiguare. Consejo esta
bienvenido.

Si quieres corregir este "post" esta bien conmigo. Necesito la ayuda. No voy
a usar acentos porque es dificil con un computadora.

Con el resto del dia fui al mercado para ver si habia cosas que podia usar
para cocinar mi cena. No encontre nada y fui a Walmart para comprar las cosas.
Pase la tarde con mi libro de Harry Potter al lado de la piscina, leyendo,
relajando, nadando, y durmiendo. Fue bueno. A las siete, fui con mis amigos
alemanes a un restaurante donde sirven comida mexicana y vegana. Fue un poco
caro pero me gusto. Despues fui con Nick a un bar que se llama La Mezcaleria
La Fundacion. He estado a este bar antes pero no me acorde el nombre. Claudia
llego con sus amigos a las once de la noche y tuvimos mucho diversion. Nos
fuimos el bar solo antes de las tres de la manana y regrese al hostal.

Back to the Beach - Apr 10
---
That was a difficult post there. I'm not sure about this, but if you don't
speak Spanish, I'm pretty confident that Google Translate will give you the
right jist of the story. So I woke up today just after nine in the morning
even though I wanted to sleep in a little bit because I told Nick that we
would go to Progreso's beach today. I got my stuff together, had breakfast
and ran into my friend Etienne who I met in Sayulita. He's a French guy who
has been living in Mexico City and recently, has been travelling through
Mexico. I love running into people like this. We're literally on the other
side of the country and we ran into eachother. Awesome stuff. Once Nick
arrived at the hostel, he also said hello to Etienne and then we caught our
bus to Progreso quite a bit later than we told Claudia who was also coming
to the beach.

We met with Claudia at the bus station and grabbed some shade on the beach
in the form of a 100 peso umbrella. After a little relaxing, multiple
switches between Spanish and English, a few dips in the ocean, and a ton of
jokes, we went to Heladios for food. This is a pretty cool restaurant. First,
you order a drink and then you are bombarded with tonnes of appetizers and
snacks. I swear you wouldn't be able to count how many if you stayed for any
substantial amount of time. It was a good time. After we had sufficiently
stuffed our faces with appetizers, snacks, ceviche, and beer, we decided to
get the bus back to town. Both Nick and I had had enough sun and Claudia had
an exam to study for.

Here are some photos:

Some photos of Cluadia. I wonder if one nice photo of a person is more
embarrassing than three photos of a person trying to cover there face in
emabarrassment. You be the judge.

When I returned to the hostel, I had zero plans for the night but I did have
two German friends that decided to stay an extra night to hang out, drink,
and have a generally good time. What more do you need? Turns out you need
beer. This is the second time it has happened to me in Merida but they don't
sell beer in stores after five in the afternoon on Sunday. I assume this is
a religious thing. We struggled around town for a while before giving up on
the notion, sadly sitting by the pool defeated. However, with some luck, we
were able to buy three beers from the hostel fridge at reception. With that
in mind we made a salad with pretty much everything I had bought the other
day, feasted, and drank. After finishing, Etienne showed up with a guitar
and what you can imagine ensued. I played guitar for 30 minutes or so and
then the Germans and I went to a bar to dance some salsa, or at least that's
why I went, I don't think they had any plans to do that. The bar was mostly
full of people from England and New Zealand who did not seem interested in
dancing. My luck. Two beers later and we left to go back to bed.
