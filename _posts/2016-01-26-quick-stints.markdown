A Night Bus That Can Make Or Break You - Jan 22
---
16 hours is definitely enough hours to break your spirit if you had any going
into a night bus of that length. Despite not feeling like I got much sleep I
seemed to be feeling the best out of the group so I tried, only a little bit,
not to complain about anything. So, 7am comes by and we stop in Oaxaca, we said
goodbye to Leonardo, the guy we met at the Palenque ADO, and he hands me a list
of places to visit while in Baja California. Righteous, people are so nice.

Check in to Check Out - Jan 23
---
It's cold man. But for real though, it's like first night of spring in Canada
cold in the mornings. I don't think I'm too prepared for that. After we checked
into the Don Nino hotel, we took a well deserved break. After our break, Jan
was feeling a little ill from the bus ride so Leif and I set out to explore the
city. As with other towns, I find, this one had plenty of character and
tonnes of people. The towns seem more dense in Mexico than Canada, at least in
the city centres.

Despite our search, Leif and I couldn't quite locate the bus stop for an
optimally timed bus that wanted to take for Orizaba. Not big deal. Having been
around with my two backpacks for quite some time now I realized that my day
bag is a little large. It's a 28L Deuter bag and it does not pack up into a
nice ball that I can thrown into my other bag. So, with that in mind, I bought
a Pinzon bag, or at least what appears to be one. I'm sure it's real. I mean,
a 90 peso backpack? Come on, for sure.

Once back at the hostel we met an interesting gentleman with some pretty
intricate theories about the world, important historic events, and things that
have happened to him during his travels. Put it this way, he told me that he
once heard some shocking truth about America's involvement in whatever from an
ex-special forces man in Guatemala, but, the gentleman's unimpressed look made
the ex-officer make a phone call which resulted in a 10-year old Guetemalan boy
running over to their table with a briefcase full of classified American
government documents. That's not even the best of them, he talked our ears of
individually throughout our stay.

Here's a church, surprise.

What to Do When You've Got Too Much Time - Jan 24
---
Since the early bus was a no-go for us on that morning we had decided to go for
another night bus, though this one would only be 4 or 5 hours. When you've got
a lot of time on your hands, I'm not exactly sure what you should. Go out?
That's what we did. So, we walked the city again, but this time with Jan who
was feeling much better. We walked up to the amphitheatre, saw some stuff, and
ran into a woman who was just leaving the city after living in Oaxaca for four
months, so cool. Maybe I should do something like that. We walked and walked,
and sat in the main square for a while where I practiced a little harmonica and
continued my struggle with the children's book *El Principito.* I think I'll
have to read this book a few times before I've got the hang of it.

Here's a photo of Leif kissing what I can only assume is a well respected
wooden statue placed on the side of the huge staircase leading up to the
amphitheatre.

We eventually settled on this Irish pub that Leif and I found the day before
for some beer and food. Lucky for us the Colorado/Denver game was on and there
were tonnes of people in the bar. The security guard, an older woman asked me
if she could check our bags to which, understanding perfectly, I obliged
willingly. Next she asked us if she could check our *espaldas.* which made me
double take. That word means back, as in where my spine calls home. You want to
check my back? OK... Now, I'm not sure if it's slang or lingo or jargon but she
basically just gave us a pat down.

We sat down, grabbed a Guiness, as you should in an Irish pub, and then started
on with the Mexican beer promotion, a common place deal where Mexican beers are
two for one. Yes please. I taught the guys a few more phrases in Spanish, which
they immediately used. *Eres bonita* does the trick it seems. It was at this
bar that I actually started toying with the idea of staying in a town for a
long period of time, maybe taking some lessons for Spanish, photography, and
maybe piano. Why not, right? After some spicy wings that would chap my lips for
days, we left, hung out at the hostel, and finally grabbed our bus for Orizaba.

Efficient Travel - Jan 25
---
This night bus was pretty much fine, either we're getting used to it or the
buses are getting more comfortable which is completely possible because the
seats in this bus were far more cushiony than before. Upon arrival at 4am,
we slowly found our way to the hotel where were greeted with a man that speaks
quick Spanish, though I'm sure it's quite average for Mexico. Anyway, after
getting through that with a tired and struggling brain, I realize that I never
ask people to slow down or even if they speak English. I feel like that might
come in handy for next time I'm having a tough go of it.

The hotel was nice, we slept until about 10am when I woke up and took a walk
to the ADO station to get tickets for Mexico City. I managed, pretty easily
this time to get tickets for that night but quickly realized that our trip to
the volcano in Pico de Orizaba might take long enough for us to stay another
night. I called Jan and that was the case, so I exchanged our tickets for the
next morning.

After not being able to figure out how to easily get to the volcano we went to
the tourist office where we met Marcela, probably the most helpful person in
Orizaba. She helped us realize that the volcano is not only far away, but quite
a trek, and also expensive if you get a group to guide you along the way. We
had one person call a company for a quote who said it would be 4000 pesos for
the three of us. After saying no, the company immediately dropped the price to
2000, what a joke. Anyway, we weren't going to be able to climb this thing
because it's the biggest mountain in Mexico so instead we got a million
suggestions from Marcela. 

On advice from Marcela, we checked out the park, then took the cable car up
the mountain nearest the town centre, checked out the views, got some more
looks from locals and headed back down. We got a recommendation for a place
that serves *mariscos* and I actually managed to understand the directions.
Yay! After that, we did the river walk. Along this river they have placed a
whole whack of cages filled with exotic animals ranging from falcons, jaguars,
bears, lions, zebras, and others. It was pretty cool but also tiring so once
we got back to the hotel we relaxed for a few hours. 

Here's the best view of all.

8pm rolled around and, realizing that we need to eat dinner, we sent a message
to Marcela asking for a recommendation for a restaurant. Thanks Jan, for asking
for her number at the tourist office. A little later, Marcela showed up at our
hotel with her friend Anna in her car and they took us out to one of their
favourite restaurants. After the restaurant we were driven around the city,
stopping at some of Marcela's recommendations that we didn't get to during the
day. These included the lagoon, where Leif and Jan took a icy dip. I almost did
but quite, these goofballs are starting to influence my decision making I
think. We also drove by a few notable buildings and explored the park again.
Last, we went into a park that had in it one of those small theatres with weird
acoustics. You stand in the middle, speak, and you can hear strange
reverberations and echoes, pretty neat. After that we were driven back to the
hotel where we bid farewell to the girls. Thanks so much for everything Marcela
and Anna!

Tomorrow we are going to try out some *memelitas* and then catch our bus for
the huge Mexico City where we're going to meet up with Gonzalo again and,
clearly, have the time of our lives. See you then.
