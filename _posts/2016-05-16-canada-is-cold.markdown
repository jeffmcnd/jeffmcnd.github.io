First Canadian Hangover - May 08
---
I am so not fully ready for Canadian Jeff amounts of drinking yet. Just as
I am afraid to go for a run or do any real physical activity or exercise,
I should have been just as fearful of full pints of beer and screech shots.
I was feeling it, to say the least. For the most part of the day I did more
searching for phones and cars, hung out with the girl that came to check out
the bedroom that is for rent that happens to be the bedroom I’m sleeping in,
and did a little grocery shopping for daily food stuff. The other portions
of the day were spent feeling sorry for myself and wasting time on the
internet. I should finished HP or something. I haven’t been feeling
productive for a little while. Just look at the length of this day’s blog
post. Pitiful.

SIM Cards and Eating Animals - May 09
---
Right, on this day I hung out more with the residents of the house,
including the new roommate, Georgia, who is taking my bed and forcing me
to the couch. Which is quite fine, because it is call couchsurfing.com
not stayinthisnicetownhousethathasabedandfood.com.

I went and bought myself a burner phone to use while I keep trying to find
a Nexus 5 I can buy from this town. I just want to stick with phones
that Google releases quick updates for, is that so much to ask. As I was
buying the phone, however, I realized that it might be fun to force myself
to use it and see how I get by. I returned back and tried to activate the
phone but it came with a prepaid SIM card, something I couldn’t use. That
meant another trip to the mall. Georgia came along because she needed
house things.

Georgia is cool and we had some fun shopping around. I finally got a
working phone but quickly realized that I will never send a text message
with the damn thing because a numberpad keyboard is something I haven’t
had to deal with since 2007 and don’t plan on going back to. Phone calls
only, it is. After a quick stop off for some dollar store candy we headed
back to the house and, as a group, we left for Adelaide, a nice restaurant
in town with Eoin, Michael, and Eoin’s friend Allie. The restaurant was
cool but a bit pricey. I have to start enforcing my budget better or I’ll
have no money to move back to Vancouver/Victoria. At the restaurant I
tried aligator which is basically chicken, breaded oysters and regular
oysters, all things I’ve never tried before. I could go without them if you
ask me. They’re good and all but I’ll probably never order them on
purpose again. At the restaurant we also met Jay and Fabian. Jay is a chef
at The Reluctant Chef and promised that he would cook me a dish with seal,
something that plays a fairly important role in the surrounding communities
I’m told. Which sounds like an experience. I look forward to it.

After that we went home and went to bed. All of the people now living in
the house either have jobs, school, or both so I think some early nights
are ahead of me and that’s cool because I think I’m a bit sick from not
getting enough sleep lately. Cool.

Cape Spear - May 10
---
Today I woke up a bit later than everyone else on purpose for recuperation
purposes and chatted with Eoin and Georgia. After getting ready, everyone
else left and I made myself a lunch and got my stuff to ride to Cape Spear.
I rented an overpriced bike and headed out. Quick tip for anyone thinking
about visiting Cape Spear when you’re in St. John’s: try and find a ride
out there. The road is hilly and lame. If you’re not in good shape you
may have some difficulty. It’s only 15km or so but it’s not that fun.
I’m sure I would have had an easier time with it about five months ago but
as for right now I struggled.

Cape Spear is a cool idea because it’s the most easterly point in North
America. Basically that’s it. The lighthouse and stuff make you feel
like you’re on the coast a lot, which you are, but I’d say it’s worth it
just to be able to say you did it. Here’s a photo I took, after which I
realized how inappropriate it is because I’m leaning on basically a
headstone for several individuals that died there. Thinking ahead: not
my strong suit.

Oh yeah, I shaved my head in Mexico, did I mention that before?

After an hour and some lunch I left back to town. The ride back took an
extra fifteen minutes because of the still crazy wind. To reiterate, I
probably wouldn’t do this ride again. Once I got back I sat down on the
couch and vegged out for a few hours to regain my strength. I got some
more groceries and made myself a meal and watched Brooklyn Nine-Nine
until now. Now I’m still tired and ready for sleep so… yeah. Goodnight,
I guess.

I Was Sitting, Waiting, Wishing - May 11
----
I did a whole lot of nothing waiting for my emergency Visa to show up.
Luckily, the card showed up just after 11am which meant I could do anything
with my day! That turned out to mean little to me and did nothing. I walked
Georgia to her workplace downtown and walked around a bit, grabbed an
iced cap and cinnamon roll from Tim Hortons because why not and headed back
to the house. I spent the rest of the night, like most other days after I had
seen the important things in St. John's, reading and watching movies. I'm
starting to feel quite lazy these days. I should probably just get back to 
travelling.

Seal - May 12
---
I spent another morning hanging out with Georgia and we discussed a variety
of topics, each more ridiculous than the next I assure you. I can't quite
remember what I spent my day doing at this point but I can say that not a
lot of it mattered because the real important/cool part is when Eoin got
back and we went out. Eoin first took me to his old high school where his
two sisters were part of a multicultural event. There was international food,
a jazz band, dancers, and a presentation on the Syrian refugee crisis.
It was pretty cool, then we went to The Reluctant Chef where Jay is the head
chef and promised me some seal.

Soon after arriving we were given our dish. It was a seal mole with some
red onion, corn, cilantro, I think mayo of some sort, served with four
tortilla chips. Seal is an interesting thing. It was slightly fishy but so
much that it was overpowering and also, also most a little bit like a pulled
pork texture. Keep in mind that I do not know what I'm talking about. There
was some Driftwood IPA at the bar so I, of course, had to get some. I think
I may have lost the taste for good beer over the course of the last little
while. It'll come back though, I'm sure. After the kitchen closed down, Jay
came out and we all hung out for a while until closing. It was a decent
evening for sure.

Wake Me Up Before You Leave - May 13
---
I didn't realize the hour of the night at the time but I was woken up by
someone who I assumed was Georgia wanting to say goodbye because I had planned
on leaving today. However, the person that sat next to my head on the couch
turned out to be Eoin's drunk cousin Declan. No big deal, but I couldn't
help but wonder why my reaction to seeing a new face in the house in the
middle of the night wasn't "Holy shit a burglar/murderer" but instead I
uttered "Whatsup?" Weird how you begin to trust a city I guess...

After trying to find a place to rent a car, drive to Gros Morne, hike for a
bit and return the car in Deer Lake I realized that the cost would be
too great to justify. People charge a lot of money for leaving a car in
Deer Lake. Like around $600. Ridiculous. So, since I missed my bus for that
left earlier in the morning, the roommates were stuck with me for anoter
night.

I spent the day the same way I have been for the last few days, sitting,
watching videos, researching stuff, reading, eating a lot, and chatting with
the roommates that passed by every so often.

Leaving on an Over-priced Bus, I Don't Know When I'll Be Back Again - May 14
---
I woke up at 6am to prepare for the bus that I had to catch from MUN that
goes to Channel-Port aux Basques. Georgia was nice enough to wake up early
and see me off, aww. I caught a taxi to MUN and grabbed the bus with no issue.
The buses in Canada are maybe a tiny bit comfortable than in Mexico, though
that could just be because the roads are maintained a bit better. Who knows.
I got off in Deer Lake, my leaving point for Gros Morne but quickly found
out that there were no companies that had available cars to drive myself
up to the park. Taxi prices would be even worse than renting a van. Crap.

Serves me right though. While I was on the bus, right after I finished
reading HP in Spanish I thought a lot about skipping Gros Morne as no one
had suggested it to me and I only wanted to go because I wanted a hike and
some nice views. Like there aren't any others in Canada that I'll be able
to see. By the time I found out I wasn't going to Gros Morne the bus had
already left so I was stuck in Deer Lake, paying a ridiculously high price
for a two double-bed room for the night. Smooth Jeff, smooth.

You Thought BC Ferries Were Expensive - May 15
---
The night before I spent all my time binging a show created by Aziz Ansari
called Master of None. I liked it. It was funny for the first few episodes
but then got into some real life stuff near the end. Things that made me
think about my life. I'm not sure if it helped, hindered, or amused but
that's how I spent the evening either way. I ate as much food as possible
from the included breakfast at the motel and took as much food and a tea
back to my room for my later lunch. I've gotta do more of this if I want
to make up the money I wasted on the room for the night.

I checked out of my room around 3pm and killed time until the same DRL bus
showed up to go to the ferry. On the bus I started reading a book called
The 4-hour Chef by Timoth Ferris. I'm enjoying it so far. I'll comment
on this book as I go, for those interested but so far the book is going
through the best ways to learn or acquire any given skill. This applies to
several different skills he has acquired throughout the years including, but
not limited to language learning (Yay!), swimming, weight lifting, and
cooking, the main "theme" of the book. I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy
this one a lot because one thing I've been thinking about lately is my
diet and my cooking habits, things I plan on messing around with when I get
back home and living.

I arrived at the ferry terminal and forked over about $45 for the ticket.
Damn. I suppose it's an eight or nine hour ferry but crap that sucked. Good
thing I didn't have a vehicle or it would have been around $150. Good news
though, there were tons of comfy looking, sleep-able seats in the lounge.
Bad news, sleeping was prohibited. I slept on the floor, it wasn't nice.
